	"description":"# Unique IRL Proliferation at 420 Tasty Trivia Events\n\n\n## A Lil Nouns Sponsorship Proposal\n\n\n## TLDR: 6.9 ETH to sponsor and brand 420 Tasty Trivia Events as Lil Nounish\n(Thatâ€™s just .016 ETH per event! This would be roughly a 6-month activation)\n\n*Robust version:*\n\nThere are so many ways to proliferate the meme and brand of Lil Nouns, so this proposal drives that attention toward already established IRL events in the Central Florida area. Tasty Trivia has been operating live trivia and bingo events throughout the greater Orlando area since 2012 and currently has consistent weekly events, special monthly theme events, and a flow of events running constantly. \n\nMarketing is all about visibility and consistency, ultimately going after the attention of the end user. In this proliferation activation, Lil Nouns, the Noggles, and a variety of memes will be used in the following ways:\n\n- Noggles and Lil Nouns web URL on trivia sheets used by teams\n- Noggles and Lil Nouns web URL on Facebook events promoting the nights\n- Noggles and Lil Nouns web URL on website events (see website traffic graphic below)\n- Images of winners and hosts with Noggles\n\n### Summary/Backstory of Tasty Trivia:\n\nTasty Trivia is Entertainment Marketing. From connecting amazing talent to the venues that want live events to online engagement, Tasty Trivia specializes in utilizing fun, interactive games as marketing tools to promote products, increase sales, and generate visibility across internet platforms and physical locations.\n\nWe strive to produce some of the most appealing, transaction-driven entertainment available anywhere, specializing in small business growth and development.\n\n### One Month of Tasty Trivia Website Traffic:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uUleLQm.png)\n\n\n### 2022 Website Traffic for Tasty Trivia:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6FbUSqN.png)\n\n### Facebook:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Eq6hBDL.jpg)\n](https://)\n\nCheck out this 5-minute run down of me showing you exactly what I mean and where:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RUrhI04P7go\n\n\n## Scope\n\nProliferation of the brand across 420 events in Central Florida. We estimate this to be just about 6 months of events, some months have closer to 80 while others are closer to 65. The Noggles and Lil Nouns visibility will be prominent across:\n\n- trivia sheets\n- online promotion\n- images of nounish activities\n\nThe goal of this proposal is anchoring the nounish vibes with irl events that are consistently occurring each week at venues throughout the Orlando area. \n\nConsistency and repetition. Consistency and repetition. This is how we can impact new individuals to build curiosity and engagement toward onboarding new and interesting people.\n\nDiscussion in #Proposal-Ideas: [(Let's Chat!)](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1041907327084810280/1041907327084810280)\n\n## Funds Requested\n\nTotal: 6.9 ETH to sponsor 420 events\n\n\n",
