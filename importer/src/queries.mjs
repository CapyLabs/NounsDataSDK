In return, we offer extraordinary Nouns visibility — from the ground, the air, ***even from space***— to eight of the largest event crowds of the year. The iconic Nouns glasses will be omnipresent, allowing Nouns to make a great first impression on a vast new audience mostly unfamiliar with NFTs or DAOs. \n\nWe will *literally* put Nouns on the map and make them part of the permanent record — the first NFT/PFP icon visible from Earth orbit — when Nouns glasses appear in updated satellite maps (Google Earth/Maps, etc.), visible to everyone at the event, near the event, or simply looking for directions near a major university and sports destination.\n\nI founded the Cancer Support Community charity beer garden after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I ran it for years as an out-of-pocket labor of love. We were attracting tens of thousands of patrons each season and potential sponsors were taking notice when the pandemic shut everything down. Unable to continue funding on my own, I sold to an LLC but I retained an ownership share that allows me a chance to preserve the community event. I'm looking for an open-minded and nimble capital source to help the beer garden remain open to the public this fall while sponsors budget for FY2023. When @4156 tweeted an invitation (see below), it was clear that a DAO could be our saving grace. Relatively modest support could positively affect thousands of lives with a *MONUMENTAL* return on investment for the Nouns community.\n\n**Benefits to Nouns**\n\n* **MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE** — massive Nouns glasses will be emblazoned on a synthetic turf installation. At 60 feet wide, they will be large enough to be visible when satellite maps are updated, meaning they'll become part of the permanent record, obvious to anyone on site *and* to anyone using Google Earth/Maps or other online navigation tools near the largest stadium in the country and a top university. Because synthetic turf doesn't require cutting and won't wear down under foot, the glasses can stay as long as it takes for the next satellite maps update. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/YA4IZkR.jpg)\n\n\n* **Nouns billboard/banner** — 12-foot Nouns glasses will watch over the crowd, evident not only to the thousands of beer garden guests but unmistakable, even at a distance, to the tens of thousands walking past on game day.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M1i9gW2.png)\n\n\n\n* **Nouns pole banners** — Nouns ubiquity continues as glasses appear in pairs on pole banners flying high above the crowd.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AtRFjN2.png)\n\n\n* **Drone photos + press release** — a licensed drone photographer will capture images of the multitude of Nouns glasses *in situ* to accompany a press release describing the event and directing people to learn more about Nouns DAO.\n\n* **TBD special event** — plans are in motion to turn the night game on September 10 into an extended affair to remember with music stage and celebrity appearances.\n\n* **And more** — Nouns glasses and URL on event signage, pint cups, staff t-shirts, event website, press release, social media, etc.\n\n**What does this mean for Nouns?** \n\n* **Proliferation** and public relations on a colossal scale: The eight-game event season will put Nouns in front of more *new eyes* than any other event. Unlike NFT-oriented gatherings where attendees are familiar with Nouns (e.g., NFT.NYC), sponsorship at the largest normie events of the year will introduce an entirely new population to the DAO in a positive and productive light — doing good for the community. There are incredible opportunities to expand Nouns brand recognition with in-person visitors immersed in Nouns iconography and countless others learning the Nouns story through media coverage of events.\n\n* **Nounish culture**: what better way to reinforce the Nouns ethos than to support an inclusive community event and serve as ambassadors to the web3 ecosystem.\n\n* **Diversity**: there's no other event like this. Nouns would be on the vanguard of DAO philanthropy, supporting the largest charity event of its kind. In return, Nouns would be the first NFT/PFP visible from earth orbit.\n\n* **Successful track record**: this isn't a request to gamble on our success, it's a well-established event looking to remain publicly accessible in its post-pandemic return. Since it began in 2016, the beer garden has attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season and grossed six figures for charity.\n\n**Who else is involved?**\nNouns DAO will join a roster of CONFIRMED partners. We're still negotiating sponsorships with a few other key players (\"TBA\" below).  We've already pitched DAO membership to some of them and plan to invite the others to join us in the web3 space. Ideally, the event series will grow in subsequent seasons with support from new high-profile Nouns DAO members.\n\n* **[Truly Hard Seltzer](https://trulyhardseltzer.com/)** — the #2 player in the hard seltzer category will expand beer garden options for thirsty patrons.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5WDruFd.png)\n\n* **[Twisted Tea](https://www.twistedtea.com/)** — The #1 contender in the FMB sector will add even more depth to the drink lineup.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziz2bks.png)\n\n\n* **[Slows Bar BQ](https://slowsbarbq.com/)** — Detroit's finest barbecue has been featured every season since 2016 and their food truck will be back this fall with premium tailgate fare.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1KvVKdv.png)\n\n* **[Zingerman's Creamery](https://www.zingermanscreamery.com/)** (& coffee) — the creamery arm of Zingerman's Deli, one of the best in the Midwest, will provide gelato and/or hot coffee/cocoa depending on the game day weather forecast.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jU8Qi2e.png)\n\n* **[Hotaling & Co](https://www.hotalingandco.com/).** — their whiskey warehouse survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire long before they became a leader in super-premium artisanal spirits; they will augment the drink menu with custom cocktails, including a signature drink created for the occasion.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RYBPJNl.png)\n\n\n* **[**Cancer Support Community**** — the local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the [national](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/) 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is our co-host, securing the state special permit for alcohol service at the beer garden; CSC volunteers staff the event and pour drinks.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G9Q0nbv.png)\n\n* TBA **national brand soft drink partner** — the largest distributor for the #1 soft drink brand in the US has signed on to provide non-alcoholic options. We're still lobbying for a partnership with the cola giant. Stay tuned.\n\n* TBA **national brand beer partner** — we're in conversations with a leading national beer brand portfolio and hope to see them become a major sponsor and the next prominent beverage company to join Nouns DAO.\n\n* TBA we're chatting with, but still have to confirm, a premium **handmade Vodka out of Austin, TX** to supplement our cocktail lineup\n\n* We've snagged **DJ WaltAmore** (house DJ at Tin Roof, Detroit) to spin for us this season\n\n* We've engaged the services of a sports marketing professional with experience in charitable event planning for organizations, pro athletes, and their non-profit endeavors. More info TBA.\n\n**What does this mean to the charity? What happens if the proposal fails?**\nIn short, Nouns support provides a stay of execution for the *publicly accessible* event. Without sponsor support to maintain community access, the charity beer garden will not return in 2022. Instead, the site will be turned over to private and corporate interests. It's a manifestation of the conflict between web2 and web3...centralized ownership versus open access. \n\nA successful DAO vote means the charity event sees new life *plus* a foundation for future growth. As in the past, 100% of beer/seltzer/FMB/cocktail sales will benefit Cancer Support Community programming: education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. Enthusiastic national brands are poised to underwrite the future of the series but, in the middle of a fiscal cycle, budget dollars have already been allocated. Nouns sponsorship this fall would provide a bridge to next season when beverage and other brand sponsors can earmark funds for their participation.\n\nIn sports entertainment marketing circles, this location is a unicorn. Of roughly two dozen properties covered by a city council resolution granting broad game day allowances to specific properties in the stadium vicinity, it's the only available vacant parcel this large. Sponsorship value has been estimated by sports marketing agencies at $12-18/sqft per game based on site characteristics, recent team performance, and media coverage that accompanies the nationally televised events around which the beer garden is scheduled.\n\n* Proximity to venue — 285 yards to stadium gate\n* Generous open space — over 10,000 square feet\n* Privately owned — no municipal or university red tape\n* Existing municipal approvals for game day sales and commercial display\n* No neighbors to complain — no residential units within 400 feet\n\nHaving a respected and successful history here, the charity event has a right of first refusal to remain...but only if we can secure a sponsor. If we continue, the beer garden will offer the closest alcohol sales to the largest football crowd in the country at a stadium that doesn't serve beer (and the nearest bar a mile away). \n\n**What is the ask?**\nThe benefits to the community are beyond measure but the cost is easy to quantify — roughly the equivalent of two freshly minted Nouns. Let's check the math: the average price of a new Noun over the past 30 days is just under 110 ETH. Assuming/hoping ETH doesn't fall below $1050 before we can successfully float this proposal, two Nouns would total $220,500 — just under the minimum needed to keep the event in public hands (see cost breakdown below). \n\nAt the YTD average mint price (a conservative 80 ETH per Noun) the DAO treasury will increase by almost 6,000 ETH before the event series starts in September. We respectfully request 225.15 ETH, a little over twice the daily mint price, to preserve the community charity event. \n\n**Why are we asking Nouns for help?**\nIt's been asked, \"why should Nouns sponsor this particular event?\" There is no inherent link between Nouns and a college football beer garden but there are extraordinary benefits for both parties. A year after meeting @4156, his tweet on Feb. 17 was a welcome invitation to engage an open-minded and responsive community. “**Shill us your crazy ideas**,” he said, “**we will fund them!**” If I couldn't send a Nouns to space but I could make Nouns visible FROM space. The Nounish ethos of bootstrapped identity and community is embodied in what we've achieved and hope to continue. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M75Hg6R.png)\n\n\n\n**Where will the money go?**\nBefore the current bearish dip, 225 ETH would have been enough to ensure a long and healthy future for the beer garden. It's still enough to fund the bare-bones improvements to benefit Nouns and the event series. If funded, we'd convert crypto to fiat immediately to cover the synthetic turf installation. The Nouns flags and banners described above would be out-of-pocket-expenses. The list below includes improvements that will follow as additional funding allows (calculated at $1050/ETH).\n\n* **224 ETH: Synthetic turf installation INCLUDING 60-FOOT NOUNS GLASSES** — we've been quoted a 1.5-inch finished pile that uses an environmentally friendly backing and infill with realistic color and exceptional durability and drainage. Turf materials, excavation and installation run $14/sqft for 11,000 feet of coverage. Ultrabase underlayment panels ($6/sqft) will go in between the compacted gravel base and the turf/infill to handle large vehicle traffic (food trucks, beer trailers, buses, dumpster service, portajohn maintenance). Infill and perimeter board add $15,000 to bring the total cost to $235,000.\n\n* **0.4 ETH: Nouns Glasses Billboard/Banner** — One 6x12' heavy-duty vinyl outdoor banner with grommets and heat-welded hems \n\n* **0.75 ETH Nouns Pole Banners** — Four double-sided 2x5' pole banners and hangers, to install in pairs on two utility poles on site\n\n**Is that the end of it? What comes next?**\nTwo Nouns (225 ETH) allows the charity event to last another year, allowing time to negotiate future sponsorship. If this proposal succeeds and Nouns feedback is positive, we may draft a follow-up proposal to name Nouns as the lead sponsor of the event. It wouldn't take much to get there...maybe the equivalent of a third Noun:\n\n* **72 ETH: Fifty 10-foot Polysteel Picnic Tables** — community seating for up to 500 people at once (excl. shipping or assembly)\n\n* **25 ETH: One 40x100' frame tent with water ballast tanks** — it's less expensive to purchase than to rent for the eight events in a single charity season (excl. dis/assembly & storage cost)\n\n\n**About me, the location, and the charity:**\nI spent more than two decades as a professional photographer, winning two Emmy Awards and a pair of national POY honors before moving into software where I helped commercial and educational clients manage and monetize digital assets. I started my own business but continue to pursue this labor of love. I avoid the spotlight so there are more mentions of the charity organization than of me in Google search results. I bought the property in 2007 and hosted the community event free of charge until I was unable to sustain my out-of-pocket support and gave up control to an LLC. I remain a member so I have the opportunity to seek sponsorship for the charity event before the LLC turns the property over to private interests.\n\nWhy wait so long to say *WHERE* this event takes place? Because sports fans have passionate feelings about which teams they do and don't support. The largest stadium in the country, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is home to a team that engenders strong feelings, for *and* against.  I didn't want non-fans to react to the team before understanding the benefits.\n\nThe cause that we support is the [local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the national 501( c)(3) non-profit [Cancer Support Community](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/).

Administered by a thriving and growing community (join our [discord](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3)!).\n- We've completed a 14 day pilot of daily spaces and contests every day, with excellent results.\n\n### Pilot Metrics\n-  ~110 daily attendees, 60+ daily FOMO players \n- 500+ twitter followers (up from 0)\n- 250K tweet impressions (!!) \n- 200+ pieces of nounish content produced in 9 daily contests \n- 400+ POAPs claimed for attending the spaces\n- 11 special nounish guests\n\n### Short term goals\n- Grow attendance & engagement\n- Iterate on show format and deepen our \"show/market fit\"\n- Grow our community of hosts and contributors \n\n### Longer term goals\n- Make NOC a global Internet shared moment\n- Grow reach to thousands of concurrent participants, and later much much more\n\n### Our Ask\n- We are asking for 55 ETH total to continue this initiative for a 1 month period.\n- Doing this daily is a lot of work (about 10 man-hour a day on average. More detailed breakdown below.)\n    - 10 ETH will be earmarked for contests themed around the Noun of the day. \n    - 45 ETH will go to community contributor rewards (biweekly retro rewards administered by CoordinApe rounds, modeled after Nouncil.)\n\n\n---\n\n## Who We Are\n\nWe are a community of Nounish builders setting out to create a Daily Celebration of Noun O’ Clock called The Noun Square, administered by a Nouncil-like body and with the goal of proliferating Nouns by turning Noun O’ Clock into a “Shared Moment” for the entire Internet. We have successfully completed two week pilot using a combination of Small Grants and out-of-pocket funds for prizes (data from which which has informed this proposal)   \n\n## Our vision\n\nFor anyone who grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, “The Price is Right” holds a special place in our collective psyche. For over 50 years, its daily blend of ritual and play has entertained hundreds of thousands of people the world over.  We believe Noun O’ Clock can recreate this kind of shared experience for web3.\n\n**Broad Goals:**\n\n- **Turn NOC into a daily shared global moment** - develop a grass-root, organic, daily show that introduces more people to  nouns & its thriving community & sub-communities. As well as creates a space in which our growing community can meet daily and share a live moment together.\n\n\n- **Model our community on Nouncil** - a collective of builders all over the globe with varied skillsets, collaborating to organize and administer a daily Twitter Spaces. We think that a decentralized community model can be the nounish way to scale a Noun O' Clock show! \n\n- **Be consistent (”one NOC, every day, forever”)** - Even in the deep NOC winter, we believe consistency is key to cementing NOC as a daily celebration for the Internet. We are planning ahead for this with hosts from all over the world.\n\n\n## The (Current) Format\n\n- Begin 15 min before NOC every day.\n- Contest review & announcements.\n- Casual guest interview while watching/discussing end of daily Noun auction.\n- Play FOMO Live together (we invite as many attendees as possible to come on stage and keep mics open for an interactive experience.)\n- Give live Secret Word for those who wish to collect POAP for attendance.\n\n*On weekends, we run a LITE version of The Noun Square featring only FOMO live, hosted by a different nounish community every Saturday (e.g. Lil Nouns and GOOP DAO the past two weeks, future guest hosts Nouns DAO Japan, Korean Noun Fans, NounPunks, FloriNouns, etc.)\n\n## The Team: 3 C's\n\n**Core Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n- Toady Hawk\n- Noun 142\n- Ser Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Goldy\n- Joshua Fisher\n- Maty\n- Benbodhi\n- !Xargs\n- Sam Ellis\n- Aubtoshi\n- RyanMac21\n\n**Community (Talent Funnel for Council)**\n- Growing Discord Community\n\n## Growing the community\n\n- We want to grow the community and **build in the open.** We have created a Discord server [open to anyone who wants to contribute.](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3) We have also created a public Google Sheet that tracks our progress and metrics and future plans for [anyone to follow along](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Hosting a live Spaces every day is an audacious goal (albeit one we are excited about), and will require participation and help from Nounsfolk in all timezones, especially as NOC drifts into the North American Night.\n\n## Compensation Model\n\nOur ask for the next 30 days is 55 ETH:\n\n- **Contest rewards (0.5 eth/day * 20 weekdays = 10 ETH)**\n    - We will experiment with these numbers and the cadence of them as we move forward, but so far this amount and cadence has produced excellent participation.\n\n- **Team reward + operations (see budget below): 45 ETH**\n    - Because we intend to build this initiative as a community effort, we will be modeling our team reward, at least for the first period, on Nouncil’s proven model of a Coordinape round, where all active participants will allocate tokens based on contributions.** We think this will ultimately be a fairer and more frictionless way of properly rewarding the team than attempting to itemize every hour of effort, etc.\n\n    - Based on our pilot, we  estimated how many man-hours it takes to run a show like this every day. We think these are reasonable overall estimates. \n    \n    \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wj7gtHWz/image.png)\n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RZk5Nt61/image.png)\n\n## Multi-sig\nFunds will go a new 3/6 gnosis safe, with the following signers:\n\n- 142\n- Toadyhawk.eth\n- maty.eth\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Ser Noadz\n- Benbodhi\n\n\n\n# Two-week Pilot Results\n\n### Twitter analytics\n\nMassive reach within 14 days!\n\n![twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1XK4RJYb/twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png)\n\n\n### Space Participation\n\n\n- Attendance has been growing every day to average around 115 people a day.\n- We hit FOMO players ATH at 110 on our first pilot space and have been averaging between 60-70 every day.\n- Twitter growing by approximately 30 followers per day so far.\n- Averaging 30 entries to our daily contest, with many high quality submissions.\n    - NB: Small Grants sponsored our first Week of contest prizes (thank you!) Noun Square Team members Toady Hawk and 142 have agreed to fund the current week’s prizes out of pocket to keep morale high pending approval or disapproval of this broader proposal.\n    \n![tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wBbGZzqG/tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png)\n    \n(Excerpt Above from our [Public Tracking/Planning Document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n### The Contests\n\nInspired by 4156 ad-hoc contests a few weeks back, we have run 10 contests with really great engagement and wonderful creativity from noun lovers on twitter: \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ncsnrpSJ/image.png)\n\n![bag-found-art.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fyB659r6/bag-found-art.jpg)\n\n\n![crown-haikus.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNZhfB0J/crown-haikus.jpg)\n\n\n### Gamifying NOC with POAPs\n\nWe are using POAPs to gamify NOC and create both engagement and loyalty. We feel that our use of Daily Attendance POAPs is the purest use case for the tech (literally “Proof of Attendance”) and we want to use them to incentivize people to attend Noun O’ Clock every single day if they can. \n\nSo far, it’s working! Ser Noadz has been creating amazing daily animated POAPs based on the new Noun of the Day and would continue to do so for the first month (after which we would explore other “Series” by other Nounish artists.) \n\n![IMG-2420.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/brHXK5FS/IMG-2420.jpg)\n\nWe also want to experiment with doing bonuses like physical Merch drops for those with provable streaks of attendance, and raffles that are easier to win the more times you have attended. \n\nExample Possible “The Noun Square” Merch Drop for Attendance Streaks:\n\n[![noc-cap-smallest.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FK6V4gf9/noc-cap-smallest.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FfjLbSgq)\n\n\n## Playing FOMO\n\nThe peak moment of The Noun Square is, of course, playing FOMO live and minting a new Noun together. When FOMO starts during the Twitter Space, we ask all speakers to unmute and speak their mind, to create as much chaos, interaction and fun as possible. The feedback so far has been that people have been loving it!  \n\nWe have noticed anecdotally that FOMO seems to take longer on average with more players, until we hit that beautiful noun that reaches some consensus. We think the Nouns minted over the past week or so are especially legendary, and believe it’s related to our efforts to gamify FOMO and bring in new players.\n\nThe impressive roster of Nouns minted by FOMO since we started: \n\n[![this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bYmCCbgw/this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLrkLKZ3)\n\n\n\n## Our plan for the next 30 days\n\n- **Host a Noun o’ Clock every. single. day.**\n- **Make it fun & intereting:** Run a contests, and have guests for every weekday\n- **Be inclusive:** Invite a different nounish extension, subdao or community to host every weekend.\n- **Grow the NOC community:** Invite as many interested Nounsfolk to join our Discord and share ideas, volunteer to help where they can.\n- **Curate an Organizational Committee**: will handles all the day to day tasks to keep this going in a decentralized manner.\n- **Run a Coordinape round:** At the end of each 15 day period, reward contributors by Coordinape Round.\n\n**Grow our reach:**\n- **500k Tweet impressions** on our @noun_o_clock Twitter account.\n- **1000+ Twitter following** \n- Grow daily show attendance to 125 per day, and average FOMO Players to 85+.\n- Produce over 800 unique pieces of Nounish content in the form of public entries to our Noun O’ Clock contests. \n- Teach hundreds of new people about Nouns and Noun o’ Clock through our informative and entertaining spaces.\n\n**Potential challenges**\n\n1. July gets into very late night EST and we may have fewer participants. However, we believe that consistency is key, as well as the opportunity to get more people from non-north america timezones to hear about nouns.\n2. Over-saturation is a risk of course, as with anything that happens daily. But as with The Price is Right, we hope to create a shared ritual with the community we are building, such that the daily show is something they look forward to, rather than a chore they get bored of. We are building variety into the structure of the show, with a mixture of weekly segments and novel guests and contests to keep things interesting for many, many months (and hopefully longer!) \n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nOver the past two weeks, we have kicked off a tradition of making Noun O’ Clock a daily celebration, featuring live Twitter Spaces, interactive contests and special guests. So far, people love it. (See feedback section below)\n\nWe believe that, if given funding to execute our vision detailed here, we can bring new attention to Nouns and the daily auction every day, while also supporting extension and sub-DAO communities, and engaging active Nounish builders. \n\n**Let’s work together to make Noun O’ Clock into a shared moment for the Internet!**\n\n**Feedback from attendees has been great:**\n\n> “The Noun Square gives a much needed voice to what is Nounish. A platform to congregate daily, learn and vibe, uniting Nounsfolk, and beyond, around the world!” *-Metamonk*\n> \n\n> “I don’t watch TV anymore, but I do miss the days when I would spend my evenings with David Letterman on the Late Show. It was home to me. And that is what the Noun O’ Clock team are doing right now. **It definitely feels like home to me.** ” *-Leo Clark*\n> \n\n> “This event is now something that I want to do every single day.  I am literally trying to figure out how to turn over my entire family's sleep schedule! Getting to hear my Nounish frens and what they are up to is amazing. **This event has also proven to be a wonderful way for me to onboard new folks into Nouns.** I leave this every day with dozens of new and Nounish ideas, and feeling great and motivated.” *-!xargs*\n> \n\n> “**Having a common and consistent place to gather for a Noun O’ Clock event is something folks need**--a kind of programming schedule that they can tap into every day. The engagement events have been fun and accessible and rotating guests have been a good way to introduce folks to extension projects while celebrating the nouns in general! The POAPS are great and give a feeling of being part of the history of the noun minted that day..” *-Sam Ellis*\n> \n\n> “For a couple months, I’ve tried to touch base in the Discord during FOMO as a fun way to interact with those in the Nouns eco system. **Having this extended virtual event via Spaces has taken that to a whole new level!** The Spaces, the guests (David Horvath!), the games, the prizes and the POAPs all bring different aspects of interaction, energy and motivation to attend.  Unlike 20 years ago, we rarely have shared cultural experiences as a society anymore (think TV show series finales etc.) **We have an opportunity to create one here that is open to everyone to enjoy on a global scale.** How exciting!” *- Prof Werder*\n>","endBlock":"15063967","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"68","id":"101","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xf6c625851d48fe26b50d96b821a87efc7e35c222","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1656619338","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x3e6791170d9514be84b5a1c17c217a0bffc60976"],"values":["25000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"359","startBlock":"15065352","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"35","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"2","againstVotes":"1","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15052212","createdTransactionHash":"0x68cb00fc25e133e17991695145542d8f8a99cfe9a42fc04132023bc40e993ebb","description":"# NounsDAO in Korea, Sailing PR campaign \n\n\n### Title\nNounsDAO in Korea, Sailing PR campaign\n\n### tl;dr\nOrganize sailing regatta and display Nouns Glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea.\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif)\n\n### Summary\n- Sail 40 km on five J/24 sailboats with huge Nouns-themed sails.\n- Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea (population 15 million)\n- The river is surrounded by two 20+ km highway roads, cycling roads, parks, and high-rise buildings. There are 13 bridges for cars, subways, trains, and pedestrians.\n\n### Objective\n- Promote NounsDAO via online and offline engagement.\n- Get local media coverage (Invite newspaper and TV journalists)\n\n### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea\n### Date & Time: September 17-18th, 8:00 ~ 18:00\n- September 17th: Kimpo Airport→Gangnam\n- September 18th: Gangnam→Kimpo Airport\n*(The exact date and time might be changed in case of logistics delays or bad weather)*\n\n### Map\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif)\n\n###  Description\n- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest in blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach many people during rush hours. The two-way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with painted Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam-like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. After the regatta, I think the best use for sails is to give them to the sailing teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events with the Nouns-themed sails. I am sure pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and be used for many years!\n\n### Spinnaker sail designs\nI have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses. The Nouns glasses will be permanently spray-painted at the sail makers factory.\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif)\n\n### Newspapers and local TV\nWe are going to send invitations to local newspapers and TV stations.

Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year.\n\nExpanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.\n\nAs a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible. This will allow us to peek under the hood, literally, at how Vision To Learn works and the impact these programs deliver to communities where they are available.\n\nNouns X Fitz Prescription Subscription - $300,000\nNounish Vision Van - $250,000\n\nPHASES OF EXECUTION\nPHASE 1:\n150K - Fitz Frames\n150K - Nounish Vision Van Program / Sergul\n\nPHASE 2: Fund second 50% of proposed allocation\n150K - After delivery of 1K Prescription Subscriptions\n100K - Nounish Vision Van Program - Paid upon delivery of the Van\n\nSend $575K (~550ETH) equivalent of ETH to Fitz Frames Gnosis from v2.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\n\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\n\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate 9ETH (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\n\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\n\nAdditionally, we request 2ETH in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\n\nProposal\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n\n$30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n\nFitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185. Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n\nFitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n\nVision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n\nInitial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\nAt that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n\nBased on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\nIn order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\n\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity. Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.\n\nNoun Frames\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\nAbout Fitz:\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\nhttps://vimeo.com/377468371\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415\n\nAbout Vision 2 Learn:\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/","endBlock":"15094171","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"68","id":"104","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"6","delegatedVotesRaw":"6","id":"0xbd7dbab9aeb52d6c8d0e80fcebde3af4cc86204a","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1656995331","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x5bcd6f3b0a5519d448fbdf33204091bbe097c992"],"values":["1000000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"365","startBlock":"15093500","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"36","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15080360","createdTransactionHash":"0x8357ad705b4065085f61a15b39876d82a5e74f7d6f7b486bbd6058f9a63aee78","description":"# Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO\n\n## Description:\n\nWhat started as an experimental approach for Nouns DAO to deploy capital has become core infrastructure to onboard and fund builders within the Nouns ecosystem. Consequently, the idea has been spreading. From [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843), to [Ape Coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) to [AAVE](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928), communities across the broader crypto space have expressed interest in using Prop House.\n\nI propose building the Prop House Protocol as public infrastructure with the aims of it being a tool for all to use while proliferating the Nouns meme at the deepest level.\n\n## Where we are today:\n\n### Summary:\n\n- 300+ proposals submitted\n- 2,000+ votes allocated\n- 5 active houses\n- 157 ETH committed to 52 builders across 10 funding rounds\n- [prop.house](https://prop.house) UX continues to improve\n- External interest:\n  - [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843) building their own version of Prop House\n  - [Ape coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928) are amongst the 10+ communities that have expressed interest in setting up their own house\n- Please review the [Expenses report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/) for an overview of all things Prop House financials\n\n### Proposals:\n\nAt the time of writing (06/18), 18 proposals have had enough time elapse since being funded to make a judgement on whether or not they executed. So far, only 1 out of 18 proposals has had a no-show. Overall, quality of proposals corresponding to amounts funded are still desirable. With the launch of Nouns Combinator (25 ETH single winner house), we hope to see more ambitious proposals be submitted.\n\n### Houses:\n\nWe are currently running 4 nounish houses with another two coming online soon:\n\n- Nouns Launchpad\n- Lil Nouns\n- NounPunks\n- Nouns Combinator\n- Nouns DAO Japan _(coming soon)_\n- SharkDAO _(coming soon)_\n\nWithin the main [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns-launchpad), quality has stayed consistent while proposals are averaging ~38 submissions per round:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5vpnTgd.jpg)\n\n> To view all the proposals that have been funded so far, please visit [prop.house](https://prop.house)\n\nTwo experiments were run with external houses:\n\n- Zorbs failed due to the round being endlessly spammed. Beyond the spam, there was a clear misconception in what Prop House was to be used for, hinting at more education content being needed.\n- [Mfers house](https://prop.house/mfers) has been quite a success. The [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1534967734181711880) rallied the community and the subsequent reaction points to Nouns earning goodwill as a leader in the CC0 community.\n\n## The Protocol\n\nThe protocol refers to the suite of smart contracts and open-source software that would enable anyone to run their own auctions and/or Prop House web app.\n\n### Why build the protocol in the first place?\n\nCurrently, Prop House runs as a centralized system. Each round and all of its parameters are decided on by a few people. More importantly, the Prop House multi-sig handles all the funding. As volumes grow, it increasingly becomes a risk factor.\n\nBuilding Prop House into a protocol would enable the DAO to have more control over how the capital is deployed. To illustrate, the following scenario would be possible with a live protocol:\n\n- An on-chain proposal to the DAO to set up 10 rounds at x ETH for y winners over the next 3 months\n\n### Why build it as public infrastructure?\n\nBeyond proliferating the Nouns aesthetic, I believe building public infrastructure proliferates the meme at a much deeper level hence it being the way forward.\n\n[Nouns is uniquely positioned to capture value via novel means](https://twitter.com/hongkim__/status/1533161235025260544). One of the drivers for auction demand is how aspirational the meme is. Akin to luxury goods, demand is in large part driven by psychology, not just ad spend or certain KPIs. It then follows that building public infrastructure that sets Nouns as the most forward-thinking community also contributes to auction demand.\n\nMuch more than a brand or a visual meme, Nouns is an invitation for others to join us in taking the new tools we now have at hand to rethink how we build the world around us. To that extent, public infrastructure for all is the Nounish thing to do.\n\n### To continue exploring:\n\nAlong with building the protocol, we are looking forward to:\n\n- Experimenting with bigger rounds\n- Integrating with [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/)\n- Exploring new auction formats\n  - Infinite auctions\n  - Retroactive rewards\n  - Pod and mandate specific houses\n- New nounish houses (Nouns DAO Japan, SharkDAO are coming soon)\n- Updates around the UI (past winners, voting data, etc)\n- Helping other communities onboard\n\n## Budgets\n\n### Past:\n\nTotal funded by the DAO since Dec ’21 through via proposals [23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) & [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62): - 95 ETH paying Prop House contributors (~50% still remains for Jul & Aug) - 150 ETH in funding Prop House builders\n\n### Current Ask:\n\n**Operations (600 ETH):**\n\n- 100 ETH: Adds two solidity developers to payroll for remaining 2 months (July and August)\n- 440 ETH: Extends Prop House development runway by 4 months (Sept - Dec)\n  - Team on payroll consists of 2 solidity devs, 1 backend, 1 frontend and 1 designer (solimander, vapeape, devcarrot, seneca, toastee)\n- 60 ETH: Misc expenses\n  - Smart contract audits\n  - Helping Nounish communtiies get set up (e.g. Nouns DAO Japan was ~10 ETH)\n  - Operations (infura, linear figma, etc)\n\n**Funding Builders (400 ETH):**\n\n- Capital to deploy through funding auctions. We're currently at a ~80 ETH / month rate. 400 ETH would allow for 5 months of funding across all nounish houses.\n\n**TOTAL ASK: 1000 ETH (600 PH contributors, 400 for funding builders)**\n\nWith this grant, **the funds received for one year (Dec '21 - Dec '22) of Prop House discovery and development** over the three proposals would total:\n\n- 710 ETH for funding development\n- 550 ETH for funding prop builders.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Suite of smart contracts that allow anyone to fund and deploy their own funding auctions\n- Open-source front-end for anyone to fork and run their own web app\n- Documentation to help developers and communities alike get started\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe are exploring ways to make Prop House sustainable such that no future ask is required from Nouns DAO. While we are still open to any paths forward, one that seems plausible is creating Prop House DAO where Nouns DAO has meaningful ownership of the newly formed DAO. This would allow Nouns DAO to continue to capture any upside that comes from Prop House while aligning incentives accordingly.\n\n## Multi-sig\n\nThe multisig is currently 3/5 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot, toastee, cdt and vapeape.

My name’s Kiran. I’m the founder of Verse, an autonomous NFT protocol on Ethereum. Previously, I worked on product design for PartyDAO, and in my web2 life I was a product engineer in the biotech space.\n\n### What is Verse?\n\nVerse is a protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum. What does that mean? Verse enables the creation of NFTs with an embedded market that operates autonomously without the need for a central marketplace. Here’s a quick overview of how the protocol mechanism works:\n\nThrough the protocol, a creator deploys a contract Pair consisting of an ERC-20 Exchange contract and an ERC-721 Hyperobject contract. The dynamic price and supply of the ERC-20 token is managed by a bonding curve acting as an AMM. Simply, this means that anyone can buy and sell the token at any time with instant liquidity, and the contract will programmatically adjust the price based on the circulating supply. Holders of at least 1 atomic unit of the ERC-20 token can then redeem their token. Redeeming a token transfers the holder’s ERC-20 to the paired Hyperobject contract, which mints a new NFT and transfers it to the redeemer in exchange.\n\n### What is the status of Verse?\n\nThe contracts for Verse V1 are live on mainnet, and the public beta interface to interact with the protocol is live at verse.xyz. Verse V2 is currently in development, with significant UX improvements and nounish mechanisms built into the core protocol.\n\n### What can be built on Verse?\n\nThe Verse protocol represents a new medium for NFTs, and enables the creation of digital objects that have their own embedded market. Although the NFT space is still in its early infancy, we can observe some fundamental truths about the medium. Most notably, NFTs aren’t just assets or static files or jpegs. NFTs are programmable objects built to take advantage of the internet as a meme proliferation machine. In the long-term, skeuomorphic token representations like 1/1s will diminish in the market, and NFTs with programmable supply & pricing mechanisms will dominate. A significant sector of the NFT market will be represented by these types of objects, and are best suited to be exchanged via programmable markets powered by Verse. Think about it [this way](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1530697363714605056?s=20&t=-FFqbcGhiso88p_ZAhgOlg). Does it really make sense for a meme to exist as a static 1/1? Or does it make sense for its supply and value to dynamically change based on its demand in the market and its mindshare on the internet?\n\n### NounsDAO investment in the Verse Protocol\n\nVerse is a new NFT protocol designed to catalyze the future development of programmable internet objects. Nouns is the prototype for meme proliferation and how to build a CC0 brand that permeates the internet. Ultimately, both entities are designed to build a more composable internet in which individuals build, own, and use digital objects that accrue value as they’re integrated across the web.\n\nSpecifically, Verse V2 is incorporating mechanisms into the core protocol which seek to standardize the meme-proliferation system (programmable supply, programmable treasury controlled by NFT holders) that Nouns has pioneered. Details of the exact mechanisms will be shared closer to V2’s testnet launch.\n\nWe’re closing a funding round for Verse, and firmly believe that the protocol shouldn’t only be owned by traditional venture or finance institutions - it should have ownership from decentralized groups actively advancing and building progressive technologies in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nThus, we’d like to propose an investment from NounsDAO in the Verse protocol.\nWe think that an investment/long-term partnership would be far more powerful than a grant in that an investment incentivizes both parties (NounsDAO & Verse) to ensure that the protocol builds for long-term success, and uses the Nouns brand as a playground for innovating on new NFT mechanisms.\n\nThere’s tremendous synergy between the goals of Nouns and Verse, and a long-term partnership would entail close collaborations to build future Nouns-related NFT projects on Verse, and the ability for the DAO to have a real hand in how the protocol evolves over time.\n\n### Investment Specifics\nNounsDAO invests 175 ETH in exchange for 0.4-0.5% equity into Verse Labs (the incorporated company building the Verse protocol) with an optional token warrant. These equity figures are consistent with the current terms we have with our lead investors for our most recent funding round.\n\nA portion of the funding would go directly toward purchasing a Noun, either via the daily auction (preferred), or purchasing from an existing Nouner on secondary. I want to align the interests of Nouns x Verse as long-term as possible, and believe that by essentially exchanging ownership in the Verse protocol for representation in NounsDAO, we’d create a truly symbiotic relationship. I like to think that Nouns is building the closest thing we’ve seen to an internet city, with a distinct community, culture, and economy. Much like the way tech companies in the past decade set up shop in the bay area and saw the valley as a playground for innovation, I want Verse to have a “campus” set up in the Nouns universe, and build with the Nouns brand as a launchpad for new types of NFT distribution & exchange experiments that help proliferate the meme. The key difference, though, is that while SF never received ownership and experienced upside in the success of major silicon valley companies, Nouns would directly have ownership in Verse.\n\nLogistically, there’s a couple ways the investment could work from a compliance & regulatory perspective. For starters, I’ve created an investment DAO through syndicate.io, which allows contributions in crypto (USDC or ETH). In exchange for the investment, NounsDAO would receive a proportional amount of tokens which represent ownership in this DAO. The associated legal entity for this DAO (an LLC acting as an investment SPV) would then be part of the cap table for Verse Labs, the legal entity building the Verse protocol. The SPV would in turn own the equity. Of course, this is just one option for formalizing the investment structure, and I’m happy to work with the nounders on any alternative structure that makes sense.\n\nOverall, I’m excited to share this proposal with the Nouns community, and even more excited for the possibility to partner with the DAO on building fundamentally valuable NFT infrastructure with the Verse protocol.\n\n\n","endBlock":"15135268","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"42","id":"107","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xe5e4b1ec4061d6fc932207dfc5cf96bd27fb11da","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1657472355","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xf29ff96aaea6c9a1fba851f74737f3c069d4f1a9"],"values":["500000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"370","startBlock":"15129250","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"37","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"7","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15116110","createdTransactionHash":"0x67254b7d7f25df95c3dd9465ba8ec461d9db1bcdb6beedd1c325ae6ec57239c5","description":"# Nouns funding the Protocol Guild Pilot\n\nAuthors: [Trent Van Epps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) (PG Member), [Tim Beiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko) (PG Member)\n\n# Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [@ProtocolGuild](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild) twitter\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is an invitation for the Nouns community to fund Ethereum public goods with 500 ETH through the Protocol Guild: a collective of protocol maintainers.\n\n# Abstract\n\nNouns has established itself as a prominent Ethereum project for a number of reasons.

Underpinning it all, the community has tapped into the collective power generated by bundling individual motivations into a well-designed coordination mechanism.\n\nSimilarly, the Protocol Guild is purpose built to incentivize individual contributions through a collective mechanism. This parallel alignment could be enhanced by engaging each within the other: Nouns should fund the Protocol Guild Pilot. This “engine to engine” relationship:\n\n* expresses the Nouns vision in new contexts\n* facilitates a mutually beneficial exchange of narrative value and financial value\n* weaves deeper meaning into the Nouns community story while reinforcing positive sum norms\n\n“Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games” ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8)): we should manifest the collaborative opportunities enabled by this arena.\n\n# Existing Mechanism / Funding Context\n\nWatch / listen to this [Funding Ethereum with the Protocol Guild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN97qA4gBs&list=PLhuBigpl7lqvMt8d7h4sbCmra9KbFmAdg&t) presentation or read below.\n\nIn Nov. 2021, a group of core Ethereum contributors started exploring the incentive mechanism proposed in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1454065104819916803?s=20&t=_ZC0BS5LfeCvaSbD4WxKKg) via this framing: What mechanism could help us better attract/retain talent and fund core protocol contributors?\n\nWe surfaced three challenges to address:\n\n1. Curation is hard\n  * Interested sponsors don’t have a single mechanism which curates all protocol contributors\n  * Protocol contributors interested in receiving funding aren’t sure how to self-organize\n  * Existing solutions bias towards teams & can’t surface all contributors\n2. Incentives are imbalanced\n  * Financial incentives are skewed towards newer projects with upside/tokens\n  * Existing public goods funding solutions usually don’t consider exposure to upside to applications/L2s - eg. soliciting tokens from initial allocations or recurring revenue from existing projects\n3. Churn is bad\n  * Steep learning curve for new contributors to meaningfully contribute\n  * Contributor value grows over time, but there is less incentive to stay once they are experts\n\n# Protocol Guild\n\nThrough a lot of discussion and iteration, the **Protocol Guild** was formed: a collective of protocol contributors which actively maintains an onchain registry of its membership.\n\nIn response to the challenges above, the org was designed to carry out specific activities:\n\n1. Self-curate an onchain registry of individuals\n  * Sponsors only need to know a single contract address instead of many separate team addresses, they can trust that there is quality backing it\n  * Members now have a single mechanism to coordinate around and solicit sponsorships to\n  * Domain expert members can surface part time contribs or lower profile collaborators which may be missed by other existing mechanisms\n2. Solicit sponsorships to balance financial incentives\n  * Bootstrap with high profile DAO treasuries\n  * Longterm, build norms around pre-allocation of a % of initial token supply\n3. Incentivize long-term contributions\n  * 6 month min before eligibility\n  * Vesting gets people to stick around\n  * Time weighted allocations to recognize the importance of long term contributors\n\nTo date, the membership includes over [110 Ethereum protocol contributors](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html), including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, tooling maintainers. This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 40% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow over the next year.\n\nThe Guild contracts are an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. Learn more about the smart contracts we are using for the Pilot [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html).\n\n# 2022 Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how it should be operated.\n\nWe’ve kicked off a test of the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10mm Pilot. So far, we’ve raised $5.4mm (as of June 28 2022) from a number of notable communities, including:\n\n* [2mm LDO from the Lido community](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016)\n* [200k ENS from the ENS community](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877)\n* [500k UNI from the Uniswap community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824)\n\nSecured funding can be tracked onchain through the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). We are currently engaging with a number of other notable projects to secure the remainder of the $10mm target.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Nouns community to contribute 500 ETH (2% of the treasury) to the 1 year Pilot vesting contract deployed at [theprotocolguild.eth](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) (0xF29…f1a9).\n\nThe ETH will vest to each beneficiary members listed on the underlying split at [0x84af…8ea1](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/). Each recipient will make an independent decision about how to use the ETH once vested.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild Pilot benefits the Nouns community:\n\n* Nouns’ long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for application developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth as the network scales\n  * Supporting Layer 2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching and improving modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Pilot participation introduces a new facet for Nouns as a public goods funder\n* Early support of a new mechanism recognizes another “fellow traveler” pushing the boundaries of incentive frameworks\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity\n\nWe hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between Nouns and the Protocol Guild as we scale up. To that end, we think it’s important to demonstrate impact before we scale: learn more about how we will evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round with longer vesting periods.","endBlock":"15148960","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"136","id":"108","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x4c0a466df0628fe8699051b3ac6506653191cc21","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1657574833","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x4156addedcde3e92dffe1b2cb039f3463bc1ec65"],"values":["355000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"372","startBlock":"15136910","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"37","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"4","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15123770","createdTransactionHash":"0xd1b3c160436f5b104d08e024028f94039524b067995953fa452b6d20720d9058","description":"# Nouns Brand (Clothing Brand) ⌐◨-◨ \n\n# **Nouns Brand (Clothing Brand) ⌐◨-◨ **\n\n![mockup](https://imgur.com/oNv0KVZ.png)\n*(Mockups are purely for presentation and do not reflect finalized designs.)*\n\n## TL;DR\nToday, Nouns clothes are limited to drop-shipped, plug-n-play merch.

Here's the final version of the Nouns Comic proposal.\n\n**Nouns and Storytelling.**\n\nIn a world where everything changes, humans have maintained one consistent feature and that’s the “**art of storytelling**”. Storytelling is and has been one of our favorite ways of communication, from cave-drawings and sharing tales of discovering fire to building the metaverse ~ we all want to share stories that we find interesting.\n\n**Why Comics?**\n\nNouns Comic are that fun and engaging tool that we can use to share our interest for Nouns and their exciting universe to build upon. It’s a way to keep that memetic consistency that we so desire to maintain inside the Nouns community/universe. An event, if you will, to gather around and enjoy the things happening in the community with a mixture of my wild imaginations about Nouns and how they’d interact with each other.\n\n**Nouns Comic you say?**\n\n“Nouns Comic #0” is already out and available for the community and all Noun enthusiasts. The full version can be found below.\n\n“Nouns Comic #0” serves as the “**WTF?

Everyone will have access to both *.jpeg* and *.pdf* versions of the comic and they will be accessible for everyone. Also, a very limited number of comics will be minted for collectors that are interested in owning a piece of Nouns Comic history that comes with the animated version of the cover.\n\n**Budget and Timeframe**\n\n* 10 days per comic\n* 0.5 ETH per comic\n* Lasting for 3 months (9 issues)\n\nThat will bring the total to **4.5ETH** for **9 upcoming issues** over the span of **3 months** (90 days) to be synced with **Party Nouns** (Nouns ending with 1). \n\nNotes:\n- The comics will be extended over the 3 months period if agreed upon by both parties ~ details will be discussed in a future proposal.\n- 25% of the initial revenue generated from “special editions” will go back to the NounsDAO treasury.\n\n**Proof of Work?**\n\nUndead Oracle here ~ Artist and content-creator focused on internet culture and visual storytelling through art.

With just one month of scheduling time, NounsOTG was able to plan, coordinate and complete its first multi-day activation at NFT.NYC, resulting in some planned and some unexpected exposure for the [Nouns](https://www.nouns.wtf) brand at one of the leading industry events of the year.\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/tLh2n5Z.png)\n\n### Key Moments From This Activation\n\n - Activations inside the NFT.NYC event all three days at the different event locations\n - Gnars event in Time Square where we met other nounish projects\n - Filmed at the Noun mural with the nounish film crew / [Proposal 64](https://nouns.wtf/vote/64)\n - Unexpected/surprise filming with Shopify putting NounsDAO in their official NFT video\n - In-studio filming with Stoopid Buddy / [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)\n - Sandbox event at Gotham Hall, introduced Andy Milonakis to Nouns and the different forks\n - Noun O’Clock meetups IRL / On-site hosting\n - Met notable NFT musicians and began conversation that led to a feature performance by a #1 musician in the Noun O’Clock space\n - Connected with other nounish builders and people from Prop.House\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/gWur0ZO.png)\n\n### Clear Takeaways From This Activation\n - IRL is important to solidify proliferation of the Nouns\n - IRL invites unexpected growth opportunities for Nouns\n - “On The Ground” promotion is an effective decentralized marketing tool\n - IRL brand recognition creates authentic and memorable user connection\n\n![Shopify Ad](https://imgur.com/d4v1R97.png)\n\n## WHAT’S NEXT? ⌐◐-◐\n\nMore events, more proliferation and more recognition! **Nouns On The Ground** wants to replicate and scale the success of NFT.NYC for the Nouns, by targeting 4 other major key hubs for future Nouners and Nounish builders. To clarify, **Nouns On The Ground** will be working to replicate the ROI and general recognition of the NFT.NYC activation. Flexible “on the ground” event planning is an important element, keeping the process decentralized, new and always changing. The goal of The **Proliferation Pod** will be to create new and unique experiences catered to each event.\n\nThe **Proliferation Pod** will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. The same budget used for the NFT.NYC event, which was 6 ETH, totals to 11 ETH today to adjust for the change in ETH price since initial funding. **Nouns On The Ground** can replicate these activations for the same amount as previously proven in New York with a slight added cost for travel for NFT London.\n\n![IRL Events](https://imgur.com/uJYIXYl.png)\n\n### NFT3 AWARDS (August 5-7) in Los Angeles, CA (11 ETH)\n\nA unique event that has started garnering attention from musicians and artists utilizing NFTs. The NFT3 Awards in Los Angeles and will have over 16,000 attendees which is roughly the same size as NFT.NYC. The NFT3 Awards will be the premiere NFT summer event on the West Coast. Nouns On The Ground will immediately begin planning this next activation. This will create consistency throughout the US NFT markets, as the Nouns meme continues to spread across the world in Rio, Sweden, Tokyo and more.\n\nI will have swag and merch on hand for “ Noggle recognition awards”, multiple hidden AR POAP dispensers for event POAP collecting and of course, more stickers and buttons with 10 newly featured Nouns to hit the ground. DM if you want your Noun featured this time! I will continue to post updates in this thread as we get closer to the event.\n\n### NOUNS DOTA FINALS (August 10-14) in Arlington, TX (11 ETH)\n\nThe currently undefeated NOUNS DOTA team is a guarantee for the Finals. We need Nouns On The Ground to proliferate Nouns throughout the stadium, amongst the Nouns fans and entire audience. We’ve started throwing around the idea of Noggle sports towels. Nouns On The Ground is in the NounsEsports Discord and ready to coordinate other live events to bring well deserved attention to this highly successful NounsDAO Proposal. This would be the best event of the 5 for a big T-shirt order as well.\n\n### NFT NASHVILLE (September 1-5) in Nashville, TN (11 ETH)\n\nNFT Nashville is striving to be the premiere NFT music event of the South as it brings a “festival-like” NFT event to the heart of the music capital during the Labor Day weekend. Some of the top current NFT music artists, including Sammy Ariaga, call Nashville home and have set the tone for NFT Nashville to enter the music scene with a bang. After starting through local meet-ups, NFT Nashville has quickly set a precedent for community building within this industry and the presence of the Nouns is necessary for proliferation.\n\n### NFT LONDON (November 6-7) in London, United Kingdom (18 ETH)\n\nNFT.London is being organized by the same team behind NFT.NYC, so you can already guarantee this will be one of Europe’s main NFT events of the year. With people already tweeting about grabbing tickets to this event, it is a no brainer to have Nouns fully on the ground in the UK. There is a slight increase in the funding cost for this event to account for additional travel costs.\n\n### ART BASEL MIAMI BEACH (December 1-4) in Miami, FL (11 ETH)\n\nArt Basel is another fantastic event for NFTs and proliferation of the Nouns Brand. Last year’s event in Miami Beach was the launchpad for some of the largest brands currently in the industry. This event is known for setting art trends and the Nouns meme needs to be logged in event attendee memories to close out the year in a strong way.\n\n### NOUNS ON THE GROUND OPERATION COSTS (18 ETH)\n\nWhy choose Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground for these events? I have a proven successful track record with this type of proliferation and have modeled my plans for each of these 4 events after the successful New York multi-day activation. The job will get done with added elements of surprise and key events that always arise when engaging IRL. I am also involved with multiple Nounish projects that also seek to proliferate the Nouns brand and have incorporated these projects during my activations as well.\n\n[Prop House Proposal Round 1](https://prop.house/proposal/41) / [Prop House Proposal Round 2](https://prop.house/proposal/71) / [Prop House Proposal Round 3](https://prop.house/proposal/117) / [Small Grants Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-activation/1215/3) (funded 6 ETH) / [Lost Nouns - Noun O’Talk S:1 EP:15](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth/status/1542260980046073856?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Noun O’Clock Spaces with Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1544475669266038787?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Nouns News Proposal w/Aubtoshi Avatar](https://prop.house/proposal/598)\n\n![Noun Prop House and Events](https://imgur.com/ehY6m08.png)\n![Twitter Spaces and Nounish News](https://imgur.com/qA2e2mv.png)\n\n\nNounsDAO funding Nouns On The Ground to operate in this fashion will allow this proven project to grow and scale without having to come to the DAO per each event.

Please reach out via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/NounsOTG) or Discord (aubtoshi#9612) to talk all things collab!\n\n## LONG-TERM “NOUNISH” GOALS ⌐◪-◪\nThis experimental Proliferation Pod is the next clear step for Nouns On The Ground as an appropriate scaling measure. Aubtoshi isn’t going anywhere and will continue to bring value to this community. A personal long-term goal is to be a woman Nouner. Until I have the opportunity to join the community as an official Nouner, I will continue to proliferate the Nouns in the most fun and effective ways that I can make possible. Thank you Nouners for giving me this chance to show you what we can do together, On The Ground! \n\n![Aubtoshi!](https://imgur.com/X5mwdw0.png)\n\n\n**Multi-sig Wallet Address to send ETH**: 0x5b35c3EF0acF9660a7d3fcefc2A2053a7CEC20E3\n","endBlock":"15156901","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"138","id":"110","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xce6404642bb08f897fce5317c1349656ca44f2d8","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1657634878","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x2af21e37928613582734bcbaead0919801a4cacf"],"values":["180000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"373","startBlock":"15141388","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"37","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"23","againstVotes":"1","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15128248","createdTransactionHash":"0x7cd47c3296836742d39a38acff1e329aa72548f97dbe5f8a9ce18e78c045b8cb","description":"# Re-Elect Noun 22 as a DAO Core Contributor\n\n# Re-Elect Noun 22 as a DAO Core Contributor\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cEKQzYk.png)\n\nHi, this is [Noun 22](https://nouns.wtf/noun/22).  \n\nI have had the absolute pleasure of building on Nouns DAO as a Core Contributor for the better part of this year, and would love nothing more than if the DAO would support me to continue working for the DAO with the majority of my time.\n\n### Background\n\nAfter joining Nouns DAO in the first month of the project's inception, I have been fortunate enough to have the DAO's unanimous support to be compensated to work for the DAO in a variety of roles.\n* November 2021 - `Proposal 17` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/first-residency)) funded my trial residency as a community contributor for the DAO\n* February 2022 - `Proposal 38` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/38) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/core-contributor)) funded me to continue my work on the protocol as a Core Contributor for six months\n\nMy current contract is set to expire on August 24 2022, and this proposal would renew my contract with the DAO for another 6 months.\n\n\n---\n\n### My Work on Nouns\n**1. Small Grants (SG)**\n\nThe Nouns DAO Small Grants and Retroactive Funding Pool was originally formed in [November 2021](https://nouns.wtf/vote/13).  Since then, SG has evolved into flexible pool of capital that is managed on a fully discretionary basis to serve the DAO's interests in a variety of ways.\n\nI am the lead for SG and I manage its day to day operations.  As the DAO has grown, incoming inquiry has scaled with it.  Running SG is what I spend most of my time on every day.  The group does not presently have an operational budget, and my compensation for this work is included as part of my role as Core Contributor. \n\nI'm very proud of what has been accomplished so far at SG.  The group has funded many builders and projects (detailed below) that have generated tremendous value for the DAO.  Many of the DAO's most successful proposals started as a trial sponsored by SG, and many of the DAO's most valuable community members were funded/onboarded by SG when they first joined the community.  In my experience running SG for the better part of a year, I have seen many instances in which a 1 ETH grant can generate more value to the DAO than an 100+ ETH proposal.  The crypto ecosystem is rife with rugs and scams, and that is precisely why our generosity on the individual level leaves such a lasting impression and inspires such fierce loyalty.\n\nToday, SG serves multiple roles for the DAO: we are the DAO's working capital, a Nounish venture pod, and an onboarding tool. SG has the flexibility to quickly:\n* Fund exciting smaller proposals (in concert with Prop House)\n* Vet new builders and derisk new projects by funding trials ahead of sponsoring larger on-chain proposals\n* Be a first point of contact and source of funding to onboard new community members \n* Retroactively reward builders \n* Provide time-sensitive and milestone based funding as a part of larger proposals\n* Fill other ad hoc daily capital needs of the DAO (contests, bug bounties, etc)\n\nMy daily work on SG includes:\n* Engaging with community members that request funding\n* Providing feedback on and tracking multiple proposals\n* Monitoring and responding to new inquiry over Discord and [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity)\n* Diligencing proposals to prevent waste and fraud\n* Negotiating funding terms\n* Following up with funded builders\n* Building a relationship with new builders and onboarding them deeper into the Nouns ecosystem\n* Administrative tasks  \n\nI conduct the majority of SG's operations on [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity) and in the `#grants-and-retro-funding` channel in the Nouns DAO Discord.  \n\nSince inception, SG has funded 100+ builders with over 230 ETH.  [This link contains information on everything SG has funded to date](https://noun22.notion.site/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3).

Community Building: Onboarding New Nouners / Weekly Calls**\n\nSince I first joined the DAO a year ago, I have reached out to every new member to organize an onboarding call.  To date, I have done over 100+ of these calls.  If you are voting this proposal, we have likely had one of these calls - if we haven't please reach out to me on Discord!\n\nAdditionally, I host the weekly [US Nouner Town Hall call every Tuesday at 5:30pm ET](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/nounweekly).  The call initially started as an informal meet and greet where we first got the opportunity to hear each other's voices and get to know each other, and has evolved into a more structured format where we discuss and form consensus on topical issues.  \n\nI host these calls not just to meet and build relationships with fascinating, cool, like-minded people, but I view them as integral to creating and strengthening a sense of community within the DAO.\n\nNouns is the most exciting and innovative project in crypto, but we cannot become complacent and view our success as inevitable.  The DAO's greatest long term threat is member apathy and disengagement - particularly as we have entered into what may be a lasting crypto bear market.  Members who feel lost or confused will quickly become inactive members, and the DAO will suffer as a result.\n\nI will continue to use my experience in the role to foster an atmosphere of open communication and experimentation where every community member feels they are able to contribute to the DAO.  Everyone needs to feel that their opinions are heard and their proposal ideas are fairly considered.  In my role, I try and be a neutral go-between and source of feedback to maintain harmony within the DAO.  \n\nMy involvement with Nouns has been the absolute high point of my career.  I have never felt this level of excitement and optimism about my work.  Thanks for reading this, and I look forward to continuing to Nounify The World with you all ⌐◨-◨\n\n\n### Compensation\nBeing a Core Contributor for Nouns DAO is a unique role within a unique organization.  I hope this proposal has demonstrated the value I have generated for Nouns DAO, my passion for this organization, and convinced you of why I am uniquely suited to continue in this role going foward.\n\nThe nominal $ value of my last contract with the DAO was $32k per month for 6 months.

They won a large North American tournament and currently have a 6-1 standing in the Dota Pro Circuit \"DPC\" - the most important qualifier matches leading to the biggest tournament in the world, [The International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)). \n\nThe teams' current term with the DAO will end on July 17th, after the DPC. Because of their DPC standing, they currently have a strong probability of attending the upcoming Arlington Major in August. Since our current proposal ends before this event, it makes sense to extend their term with the DAO. Their success in the rest of the DPC and the Major will determine if they qualify directly to The International.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Prop #68, an [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) was posted detailing how funds from the proposal were spent.\n\n### Timeline of Upcoming Potential Competitive Events:\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/b/bf4ae929b0d0a31086dc5ffaf3d40c355c4a17ec.png)\n\n\nJuly 17th - Prop #68 Ends\nJuly 16th-August 19th - Thunderpick Bitcoin Series TBS\nTBD July 17th-20th - Potential DPC Tiebreakers\nJuly 28th-30th - ESL Malaysia Qualifiers \nAugust 04-14th - Arlington Major\nAugust 23rd-28th - ESL Malaysia\nTBD likely September - The International Regional Qualifiers\nOct 15-30 - The International\nNovember 1st - Proposal Ends\n\n### Budget: 119,633 DAI / 99.6942 ETH (at $1200)\n* Salaries: ETH converted to DAI and distributed on a monthly basis as the team continues to represent Nouns in competition.\n    * Players + Coach Salaries: 60 ETH (estimated 72000 DAI)\n        * Split evenly amongst the players and coach.\n    * Support Staff: 20 ETH (estimated 24000 DAI)\n        * This includes social media support, design work, organizing practice, video content, organizing travel to events and to the bootcamp, player media appearance logistics, and strategically working with other Nouns infrastructure.\n* Bootcamp: 15 ETH (estimated 18000 DAI)\n    * This bootcamp fund will be deployed pending a successful qualification for an international event (ESL Malaysia, The International, etc.).\n* Builder Comp - 4.6942 ETH (estimated 5333 DAI)\n    - Sasquatch took no compensation per the [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) \n    - Organizing this project - shipping both props, operating the multi-sig, managing esports operations, and acting as a liaison between the team and Nouns DAO.\n\nWe are also adding 30 ETH to our on-chain ask in order to account for ETH/DAI volatility.

Allow us to introduce ourselves…\n\n[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/LV2e5A7.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7osmhGv5v4HIvtN321pnJa1EXrdTY4J/view?)\n\n💻 You can see more of our work [here](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co/work).\n \n\nWe’re a big fan of NFTs and explaining complex ideas — simply and beautifully. We’ve been doing it for a while with companies you may have heard of, and we’d like to do it for you.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose commissioning Ordinary Folk to create a 1-2 minute fully animated video. Explaining Nouns, how they work and why the community is so valuable.\n\n# But, why?\n\nWe know Nouns are awesome, but scrolling through all this? \n\nNot so awesome.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/YwFuI4outa3r6PYdlj/giphy.gif)\n\nA much better way to go through this information is with an animated explainer. Sure, we're biased, but the facts remain that explainers have the power to communicate complex and vast amounts of information in a short and entertaining way.\n\nWe think a project of this caliber deserves nothing but the best, and a clear explainer that explains the function and reason behind Nouns will really bring Nouns to more eyes, normies, and degens alike.\n\n# Summary\n\nOrdinary Folk would leverage our production expertise to manage, creative direct, storyboard, design, animate, and facilitate the composition of an original score, and voice-over recording for a Nouns animated explainer. The full production package.\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of our deliverables will be CC0 with open source files.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/USgwvuKFBz60A7S5hY/giphy.gif)\n\n# Ordinary Folk’s Process\n\nWe trust the process, and ours is highly iterative and linear. Feedback will be managed differently than in other projects given the nature of the DAO, more specifically:\n\nWhen the project is executed, Ordinary Folk will build out a milestone schedule to send the DAO regular updates requesting specific feedback and guidance on the tone, voice, direction of the animation. \n\nAll Nouners and community will have the opportunity to comment for each work-in-progress in discord for 24 hours. How and if we apply the feedback will be up to our discretion and expertise.\n\nThat said, given the nature of the script writing process, we would ask that we can have at least 1 Nounder that we can have 2 or 3 script conversations with to make sure the messaging is exactly what it needs to be.\n\nStarting with the first concept review, Nouners and community are directly involved in developing the product in a tangible way and Ordinary Folk will guide and decide on how to execute the project for the best product.\n\n💡 From award to delivery, the process generally takes ~8 - 10 weeks\n\n\n\nHere’s an overview…\n\n---\n## Step 1: Scripting\n\nAnimation is a visual and audio storytelling medium but you always start with a good foundation — the script. Messaging in animation is a balance of showing and telling. We'll first focus on having the script stand on its own while building a plan for the visuals and sound.\n\n💡 Scripting generally takes ~1 - 2 weeks\n\n## Storyboarding, Design, & Animation\n\nWhile we work on locking down the script and recording the voice-over, we’ll also be working on creative direction, storyboards, design, sound, and animation. \n\nHere are a few examples of each step:\n\n## Step 2: Storyboarding\n\n![storyboard01](https://i.imgur.com/QQJnRUu.png)\n\n![storyboard02](https://i.imgur.com/ijYffAY.png)\n\n\n### Storyboarding Animatic\n\n[![Storyboard Animatic SOM](https://i.imgur.com/RJtPPY6.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KG9_dUej6qcWyWNZIO4cxG3nAh-Lt0g7/view?usp=sharing)\n*Storyboard Animatic for School of Motion.*\n\n## Step 3: Design / Styleframes\n\n![styleframe01](https://i.imgur.com/C1Yaf5o.jpg)\n![styleframe02](https://i.imgur.com/J3fwudv.jpg)\n![styleframe03](https://i.imgur.com/9VKwP1E.jpg)\n![styleframe04](https://i.imgur.com/Z6YEiEB.jpg)\n![styleframe05](https://i.imgur.com/4ibNpPg.jpg)\n![styleframe06](https://i.imgur.com/nmN8FNU.png)\n\n## Step 4: Animation\n\nThe process of animation is very intentional, tedious AND the most exciting phase when you begin to see elements from the designs come to life. \n\nWe'll send a series of videos showing our work in progress (WIP). WIPs may also come in the form of motion tests or a series of gifs. When we have enough motion compiled together we'll send videos that are a mix of still a motion to show our progress.\n\n![Rough Pencil Pass](https://media.giphy.com/media/SiEiGfR0MJiaARmtff/giphy.gif)=\n*Rough Pencil Pass.*\n\n![WIP Animation of the same shot](https://media.giphy.com/media/OsfGmba8n7AtXKjF4O/giphy.gif)\n*WIP Animation of the same shot.*\n\n### WIP Examples\n[![Twilio WIP Example](https://i.imgur.com/vhJT3gu.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j2pagFQM_anX-gkFjM-Lq_qOjHM1NlbC/view?usp=sharing)\n*Twilio WIP Example.*\n\n[![School of Motion WIP Example](https://imgur.com/vbvik4M.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h1GNwX7DqwD5vk0YCk2pRgLdsgZmUN6-/view?usp=sharing)\n*School of Motion WIP Example.*\n\n## Step 5: Sound\n\n### Voice Over\n\nWhen the script is locked we'll begin the casting for a VO actor. From there we'll have the actor record the script.\n\n### Score & SFX\n\nThe composer will begin scoring when we have a locked animatic with the final VO timing. We'll constantly be tweaking the score and animation to match and elevate each other.\n\nSound design (the process of adding sound effects) and sound mixing (adjusting the levels of the VO, score, and sound effects.) are the finishing touches of our projects. Adding a final level of polish to our work.\n\n# The final product\n\nHere are a few of our favorite pieces which may inspire our work with Nouns:\n\n[![Minima](https://imgur.com/kYoX9OY.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/691634099)\n*Minima*\n\n[![Webflow](https://imgur.com/EkjA6Vy.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/664409837)\n*Webflow*\n\n[![School of Motion](https://imgur.com/20aDMXs.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/360269073)\n*School of Motion*\n\n\n[![SAP](https://imgur.com/AGzRs5x.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/368584682)\n*SAP*\n\n\n# Technical Specs & Delivery\n\n### Specifications\n\nWe’ve scoped this project with these specs:\n\n- 1x - 1 - 2 minute animation delivered in two renders optimized for web and prores.\n- Designed and mastered in 4K, 16:9, 30fps.\n- AE animation project files for CC0 use.\n\n# Pricing\n\n| Description | Pricing in ETH |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees: Creative Direction, Design, Animation, AE Project Files for CC use | 115 ETH  |\n| Original Score | 8 ETH |\n| Voice-over | 2 ETH |\n**| GRAND TOTAL: | 125 ETH |**\n\n💡 Noun 347 will receive a finders fee of 7% of the total price\n\n\n---\n\n# Production Schedule\n\nIf executed, we’ll deliver a production schedule of 8-10 weeks with a start date not to exceed September 1.\n\n---\n**Thank You!**\n![image alt](https://media.giphy.com/media/xKVASQrGgLX0rIjxpz/giphy.gif) ","endBlock":"15180938","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"123","id":"113","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xa68fdb0c7ecdc404637c5c06bab82a7bf00609f3","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1657913206","calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000006229c811d04501523c6058bfaac29c91bb586268"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03"],"values":["0"],"totalSupply":"376","startBlock":"15162307","signatures":["setDescriptor(address)"],"quorumVotes":"37","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15149167","createdTransactionHash":"0x2f70930054a5555d50457affbbe8d571eb66f8e955b7e6692c0a753d65df40b5","description":"# Descriptor V2 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal activates a new version of the Nouns Descriptor contract, which contains many improvements upon the previous version. The Descriptor is the contract that stores and renders Noun artwork and token metadata.\n\n**Descriptor Improvements**:\n\n* Significantly cheaper on-chain art deployment, which largely benefits builders that fork the Nouns protocol. The gas required to deploy the Nouns artwork has been reduced nearly 5x.\n* Improved external API, which boosts composability by allowing external contracts to more easily hook into the Noun artwork and rendering engine.\n* Improved descriptor upgradability. The new descriptor separates the artwork, renderer, and facilitator contracts, which enable much cheaper upgrades (e.g. trait retirement).\n\n**Note**: This proposal is separate from the 8/8 art additions, which will be proposed separately in the coming weeks.\n\n* [Specification](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-tech/blob/main/descriptor-v2/README.md)\n* [Pull Request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499)\n\nThis code has been reviewed by multiple technical community members, has unit/integration test coverage, and has been tested on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.\n\nIn addition, we’ve retroactively fixed seven art errors and oversights. These fixes will not only apply to art moving forward, but will reach back in time to correct Nouns that contain the offending traits. All fixes are either recoloring of existing pixels or removing of extra pixels. Most errors are likely a result of iteration and palette color reduction prior to the launch of Nouns - some that melded two colors into one, or put two formerly-different colors closer to one another. No pixels are being added in this update. Emoji voting in discord indicated support for this effort.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SSAquuV.png)\n\n**Piggybank**: Removal of cluster of erroneous pixels around the tail region.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Beer**: There are several pixels that are only slightly off in color. They've been filled in with the correct color so it's all one full-bodied beer.\n\nReason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.\n\n**Multicolored glasses**: There are inconsistent rules applied to this trio of frames, resulting in a distracting appearance from one to the next. Additionally, this fix helps retain the frame shape unless they're going to blend into the head, which is an anomaly.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Watermelon frames**: These were the same color as the Guava frames. This pushes them into riper, melony territory.\n\nReason for error: Likely palette crushing creating weirdness.\n\n**Fog Grey body**: This was the same color as CRT beige. This pushes it into foggier, greyer territory.\n\nReason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.\n\nPlease reach out in the [#54-tech-grants](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/981584123225321503) channel in Discord with any questions ⌐◨-◨","endBlock":"15182017","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"137","id":"114","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xac56e6156c9c0c56b6d9a4e8388799f25d7feb86","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1658183827","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"CANCELLED","targets":["0x660f6d6c9bcd08b86b50e8e53b537f2b40f243bd"],"values":["80000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"379","startBlock":"15182450","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"37","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15169310","createdTransactionHash":"0xb503cb75b66c65122240510f452b2f3cda09798475984f958aa2ed8fa88585af","description":"# Nouns DAO at FWB FEST \n\n**TLDR**\nThis August, the Friends with Benefits community will be hosting [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help), a three day immersive conference and festival to discuss the current state of how Web3 is affecting culture. \n\nOver forty keynote talks, performances, and sessions have been programmed by the community to take place over this 72 hour symposium. FWB is looking for support from Nouns DAO to publicly amplify these conversations to the wider Web3 community and beyond, under CC0 and a content distribution partnership. \n\nAdditionally, we’d like to use this as an opportunity to craft a culturally oriented session around Nouns DAO at the conference, while bridging our communities together through this DAO-to-DAO collaboration. \n\n**Who We Are**\nFriends with Benefits is a worldwide group of creators, thinkers, and builders who sit at the intersection of Web3 and culture. As one of the earliest social token communities, FWB’s members span a diverse range from the heavily crypto native to the more recently, and eagerly, onboarded. \n\n**Introducing FWB FEST**\nBetween August 12-14, 2022, FWB will be hosting the inaugural [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help) in Idyllwild, California to bring together our global community to discuss how Web3 will continue to shape the future of culture. \n\nThe FWB community aims to grow FWB FEST into a premier conference that annually showcases leading topics and conversations around how Web3 is affecting culture. \n\n*FWB FEST will:*\n* Gather ~500 community members IRL \n* Livestream the event to thousands more digitally \n* Take over the historic 200+ acre campus of the Idyllwild Arts Academy in the San Jacinto Mountains outside of Los Angeles\n* Feature a world class speaking and music lineup including:\n\nPerformances: James Blake, Pussy Riot, Oneohtrix Point Never, L’Rain, Weyes Blood, Mustafa, and more \n\nSpeakers: Hayden Adams (Uniswap), Nadya Tolokonnikova (Pussy Riot, Unicorn DAO), David Rudnick, Meltem DeMirors, Glen Wyl (Radical Exchange, DeSoc), Toby Shorin (Other Internet), Kei Kreutler (Gnosis), Yancey Strickler (Metalabel, Kickstarter) & More\n\nFull lineup [here](https://fest.fwb.help/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLnuCD7.jpg) \n\n\n\n\n**How can we partner?**\n\n**FWB FEST Content Co-Brand and Distribution** \nFWB, with support from Nouns, will capture and record the keynote talks from FWB FEST and make these talks publicly accessible to the world under CC0 through concise video formats. All talks would include Nouns DAO logo placement.\n\nKeynote sample conversations at FWB FEST include:\n\n*Cultural Currency*\nNadya Tolokonnikova (PussyRiot, Unicorn DAO), Hayden Adams (Founder, Uniswap), Trevor McFedries (Brud & FWB)\n\n*Future of Identity & Soul Bound Tokens*\nGlen Weyl (Author, Radical Markets), Christopher Kulendran Thomas (Founder, EARTH), Puja Ohlhaver (Researcher)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Hxr1GRg.jpg)\n\n\n**Nouns DAO Keynote Talk at FWB FEST** \nFWB will organize a keynote talk with and about Nouns, giving people a chance to contextualize Nouns in both an IRL and a thought leadership context. This talk would be crafted in collaboration with Nouns holders to ensure proper representation and storytelling, and would be crafted in collaboration with Jacob Horne and other outspoken Nouners.\n\nThe keynote talk will be hosted live at FWB FEST in front of an audience of ~500 guests, and will be recorded, edited, and distributed as one of the highlighted talks at FWB FEST. \n\nThe main objective will be to contribute public content about Nouns DAO that is tasteful, personable, culturally aligned, and encapsulates a different perspective than the current existing Youtube explainer video formats.\n\n\n**Hosting Nouns DAO on NFT Pirate Radio** \nAs part of this strategy we would also invite Nouns representatives to speak on our most popular digital program, NFT Pirate Radio. \n\nNFT Pirate Radio is presented in collaboration with OpenSea on Twitter Spaces and averages 2,000+ live listeners for each episode. Previous guests of Pirate Radio show include: David Choe, Aaron Penne, Mindy Seu, Andrew Benson, Vivian Fu & Noah Kalina (JPEG2000), and Possessed. \n\nAll NFT Pirate Radio sessions are also recorded and will eventually live as evergreen assets to be further amplified. \n\n**FWB Works in Progress**\nLastly, we would commission a writer within the FWB community to meaningfully tell a story about why Nouns DAO represents an interesting model for brand proliferation via a long-form written piece on FWB Works in Progress, our editorial platform. \n\nPast pieces WIP include:\nWhat Co-Ops and DAOs Can Learn From Each Other by Austin Robey which has garnered 300,000+ impressions. \n\nIn addition to the media strategy above, FWB would integrate Nouns DAO in a few other ways.\n\n**Recognition as official partner of FWB FEST** \nAs an official partner, Nouns branding would be included on the FWB FEST website as well as the FWB newsletter, social media accounts, FEST promotional assets, and on-site guide. \n\n\n**Nouns DAO Ticket Raffle for Nouns Community** \nNouns DAO to receive 10 FWB.FEST NFT tickets to raffle off and give away to Noun community members. \n\n**Why?** \nWe believe this is a meaningful initiative for the Nouns community because it will:\n\n* Democratize and distribute the keynote talks and conversations at FWB FEST for the entire Web3 community to consume, irrespective of location and travel ability.\n* Contribute effective storytelling and thought leadership about Nouns DAO with a cultural perspective and lens \n* Leverage FWB FEST with its high concentration of web3 native and culturally aligned community members. \n* Utilize additional FWB distribution channels like Pirate Radio and FWB Works in Progress to further amplify Nouns storytelling from a cultural perspective \n* Create an initial playbook that Nouns can use to further collaborate with other DAOs\n* Support FWB in its endeavor to create a premier conference and festival experience bridging Web3 and Culture\n\n\n**Funds Requested** \n30 ETH | Video Production Team: Equipment, Labor, Time, Housing, Travel, and Editing\n30 ETH  Stage Production, Lighting, Sound, Venue, and Hard Costs\n10 ETH | FWB FEST Tickets for NounsDAO\n5 ETH | FWB Editorial Commission\n5 ETH | FWB Pirate Radio Nouns Talk Production\n\nTotal: 80 ETH\n\nAll deliverables will be executed between FWB FEST (August 12-14) and September 30th, accounting for proper editing, marketing, and distribution time. \n\n**Who Is Behind This Proposal?**\n\nMembers of the FWB Community & Team Including:\nGabe Quintela, Partnerships\nLindsay Howard, Curatorial & Brand\nAlex Zhang, Mayor\nPaul Tao, Events, Operations\nZach Tetreault, Programming \n& More\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QE0WmMP.jpg)\n\n\n*Relevant Links*\n[FWB FEST Website](https://fest.fwb.help) \n[NYT Feature on FWB](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fwbcollection/?hl=en) \n","endBlock":"15202160","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"0","id":"115","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"1","delegatedVotesRaw":"1","id":"0x17cd072cbd45031efc21da538c783e0ed3b25dcc","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1658376434","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x4b4a63e170aac970f45522fb6669a6f268cd672f"],"values":["175000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"383","startBlock":"15196838","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"38","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15183698","createdTransactionHash":"0xa1c98928ba1f3d68dc76b9aa876edf893b50a8931b4f3ecf15bde1eb75b998d3","description":"#  Monthly Nouns Comics for mass market release \n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/4/4c07d23a7af2e10e5a36289f75f28e869e9c743a.jpeg)\n\nTl;dr\nA monthly cc0 Nouns comic for Nationwide Distribution.\n\nAn initial 6-issue series would be commissioned for a total of $210,000 USD, paid for by selling 7,000 copies of each issue with an exclusive cover to NounsDAO, to be distributed (or sold) as seen fit. The money will be used to pay for all the creatives as well as ensure the work is owned by NounsDAO (both writing and artwork).\n\nThe team, led by DefaultedUser, a 25-year veteran of comics publishing, will create a comic meant to be released not only to the Web3 community but to comic book stores via Titan Comics and to book stores via Penguin Random House.\n\nThe Community will be allowed to vote on aspects of the publishing project starting in July 2022, with the first issue to release to the community in November 2022, and the mass market in March 2023.\n\nAfter issue #6, profits will be used to publish future issues, still with community involvement, as well as fund other Nouns related publishing projects.\n\nIntroduction\nComics have been an art form for over 100 years now, in many ways overtaking novels as the most important written form of creativity for society, and defining Intellectual Property more than Film or Television. Comics have the advantage of a monthly (in some cases) publishing cycle, are able to pump out more content than other mediums, and so are able to connect with a dedicated audience more frequently, as well as generating more stories than other mediums.\n\nComic Books have brought us Spider-man, Superman, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Uncle Scrooge, Garfield, The Far Side, and quite literally tens of thousands more. Nouns is a visual creation, with much room for growth. The dedicated fanbase mimics that of core comic book publications of the past, giving the space and time to grow and be recognized by the worldwide community as a whole.\n\nI have worked in the comic book industry for 25 years now, acting in various roles, but most notably as a publisher for various companies (Including Boom! Studios), as well as creating comics for properties such as Divinity: Original Sin 2, Transformers, Farscape, Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Mickey Mouse, Frozen, Pixar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-man, Thor, Star Wars, and many others.\n\nIn licensing, one is required to work within certain parameters, while creating a compelling product. This will serve me well when creating Nouns product, being able to listen to the community and create something appealing for the community, while also something that can be successful outside of it.\n\nI have extensive knowledge of how to create compelling content and have a publishing and distribution agreement with Titan books (and through them Penguin Random House), so can focus on making this product physical in nature, and not just a digital offering, as well as something that will see Nouns splashed all over thousands of stores.\n\nUtilize comics to generate constant content, keep the community engaged.\nDevelop stories, worlds, and characters that give more sandboxes for the community and other creatives within the community to play with.\nBring Nouns to the “Mass Market” (Comic book stores, book stores, big box stores, book clubs, libraries). Gives legitimacy to the IP, and expands the potential community.\nCommunity Driven Support\n\nNouns is famously known for its treasury, often used to create interesting projects that further the Nouns ecosystem. What we are proposing is to engage and encourage the community to support the project, creating a financial model that isn’t solely dependent upon a treasury, and using that to expand the area and influence of NounsComics.\n\nMuch like Kickstarter, IndieGogo and Substack have used a model that allows early supporters to get exclusive items, while also funding projects that they have an interest in, and so too will NounsComics. The first engagement is to the Web3 community, as well as the Nouns community, offering access to exclusive comics, covers, and finally the ability to vote as a community on artists and authors, story beats, and covers.\n\nThe initial project will be a six issue comic book, along with a graphic novel release. NounsComics will pre-sell this series, in individual segments. The initial offerings will be:\n\nIndividual issues for sale, as well as the graphic novel (as a package)\nA minimum order of 7,000 copies for sale, which will give an individual or community the chance to commission a special cover of the comic book, which will then be only available to them, to be distributed as they see fit (sold, given away, stored, etc.)\nSales of graded copies of the individual comics, to be graded and placed on the blockchain for them via an NFT once the book has been printed. The specific grade is out of 10, with 10 being absolutely perfect in every way (and is almost impossible to attain), so the grades will be at LEAST 9.6, with the final grade being between 9.6 – 10, randomized.\n\nIndividual comics are priced at $5.00 USD dynamic value\nThe Graphic novel is offered at $30.00 USD dynamic value\nThe graded comics will be offered for $250.00 USD dynamic value\nEvery purchase not only helps fund the project, but will also give the purchaser the right to vote on certain aspects of the comic book series. The individual things that can be voted on are :\n\nThe story concept and writer of the project. We will offer a minimum of 3 choices at the outset, prior to the project going on pre-sale. Each of these concepts and writers will be vetted, to ensure to plagiarism, as well as the ability to deliver a commercially viable product.\n\nThe art style and artist of the project. A minimum of 3 art styles and artists are made available for a range of options. Each of the artists will be vetted to make certain they are capable of delivering a product that will be entertaining, engaging and finally released on a timely basis! Two different styles for publishing are included below.\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/3/3140a561969c3d990dd63159d9063bdddac92511.jpeg)\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/9/9c232c4b6d6af9aca8bf953c610d39eb525c65f2.jpeg)\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/a/a312ffa11cea1e8c36d9f725b72bdc1b25d85d57_2_1380x664.jpeg)\n\nWhich Nouns will be in the comic series. We will want to make sure that those that pre-purchase the series get to suggest and vote for various Nouns, with the top voted not only appearing in the comic series, but also having the Nouns owner engaged to create the voice and personality of the Noun appearing in the comic series.\nFor every single comics cover there will be at minimum 3 concept sketches provided, with votes choosing which one becomes the final cover. The same process will be used for the graphic novel.\n\nAll funds raised in this manner will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, with funds being released to move the project along, specific amounts for each portion of comic creation and issue.\n\nSo, a specific number will be released for the script to be completed for issue #1. After that is approved, a specific amount will be released for the layout of issue #1. After this, an amount will be released for the pencils to be finished for issue #1. Finally, the remaining sum allotted for issue #1 will be released for Colours and Letters of Issue #1. The same process will be repeated for Issues #2-6. In this manner we can keep progress moving in a timely manner, making sure that there are incentives to create the content quickly, but also doing as good a job as possible.\n\nAs the issues are completed, profits (if there are any) will be split in this manner : Payment of 25% of the profits to the publisher of the series. 25% of the profits to the NounsDAO Treasury itself. 40% will be held by NounsComics to keep the series running, and potentially fund new series down the road, and finally 10% to ComicsDAO, who will be onboarding the writers, artists and community members for votes and sales.\n\nWe use the community to fund and engage with the project\nWe pay back to the community with the success of the project\nThere are various onboarding points to the project that can make the community feel invested, choosing which Nouns appear, the feel and style of the project\nAs this project is printed, it will also be sold into comic book stores (and book stores in the case of the graphic novel). This can allow those not familiar with the Nouns community to see what it is capable of, and gives them a simple yet effective point to become engaged themselves. We have a publishing deal for both markets with major publishers, which is how we will accomplish this, NOT through independent publication.\nProfit and Loss\n\nJust some general calculations for the project :\n\nIf we assume a creative cost for the project of $210,000 USD for the six issue series (broken down as $35,000 USD per issue), we would need roughly 7,500 copies of each book sold to pay for printing and creative.\n\nIf we achieve 10,000 copies sold per issue, along with 200 copies sold of the physically graded comics, the financials would look like this :\n\nRevenues : $675,000 USD\nExpenses: $330,000 USD (this includes creative, printing and grading)\n25% to NounsDAO : $86,250 USD\n25% to Publisher : $86,250 USD\n40% to NounsComics : $138,000 USD\n10% to ComicsDAO : $34,500 USD\nFinancial Breakdown\n\nPer issue Cost:\nPencils : $8,000 USD\nScript : $3,000 USD\nInks : $3,000 USD\nColours : $5,000 USD\nLetters : $1,000 USD\nEditing/Scheduling/Management : $10,000 USD\nBonus for completing book on schedule : $5,000 USD\n\nTotal cost per Issue : $35,000 USD\n\nSchedule:\n\nUpon execution of proposal : $40,000 USD to publisher.\n\nAugust, 2022 : Post images for covers to issue #1, open up comics for sale, provide detailed artwork for voting, as well as detailed story outlines for voting.\n\nSeptember, 2022 : Artist, writers and other voting elements will be finished, and work will begin on issue #1.\n\n$40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nNovember, 2022 : Issue #1 complete, Issue #2 & #3 written.\n\nSolicitation submitted for sale into comic book stores (for February, 2023 release in stores). Sneak preview available to all who pre-purchased the book.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #1, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nDecember, 2022 : Issue #2 complete, Issue #3 penciled, Issue #4 & #5 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #2, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nJanuary, 2023 : Issue #3 complete, Issue #4 penciled, Issue #6 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #3, $50,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nFebruary, 2023 : Issue #4 complete, Issue #1 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Pre-ordered books will also be shipped to individuals that placed an order for them. Books that were ordered as graded will be sent off to CGC in order to be graded.\n\nMarch, 2023 : Issue #5 completed. Issue #2 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Same process with pre-ordered books, as well as books ordered as graded. Graded copies of Issue #1 will be shipped to individuals that ordered the book.\n\nApril, 2023 : Issue #6 completed. Issue #3 is available for sale in all relevant places, same with pre-ordered books, etc.\n\nSeptember, 2023 : Graphic novel for the series will be available in book stores throughout North America and Europe.\n\nMulti-Signature Wallet\n\nA wallet with signatures from DefaultedUser, JoshuaFisher and SharkDAO will be used to hold the funds that are released from NounsDAO, as well as sales from all books to individuals and communities. Sales from physical copies and stores will see the money placed in this wallet as well, after the expenses are removed by the Publisher (sales, printing, distribution, etc.)\n\nAll expenses will be itemized and available upon request online, to ensure that the wallet will contain the appropriate amount of money at all times.\n\n25% profits to NounsDAO\n\nThe goal will be to make this a profitable endeavour in order to not just perpetuate published projects for the Nouns community, but to also generate revenues for the Nouns, in return for the initial support, concept generation, and paying back to the community. This will be achieved by placing 25% of the profits in a separate wallet, to be used to purchase Nouns. This will place the money back into the Treasury, and allow us to place additional publishing and content creation proposals ourselves, along with giving us a voice in our ability to vote on initiatives that we are supportive of.\n\nConclusion\nWith this approach, we can engage with the community, incentivize them to participate, and also grow the ecosystem beyond Web3. Until there is an easy onboarding process for the non-Web3 natives, Nouns cannot grow beyond this space. This might seem like an obstacle to overcome, but in fact, it is an asset. Most projects start from zero, with no supportive community to support it, and encourage others to participate.\n\nWe will leave with one story, that illustrates how dangerous no community is, and how it can make or break a project. A comics creator named Jeff Smith published a book series called Bone way back in 1991. At the time, it was one of the few black and white comics, didn’t have the monthly schedule that buyers liked, and was completely different from what was being published at the time. Jeff has commented repeatedly in later years that he nearly canceled the series numerous times within the first 10 issues. It was a very small community that supported his early works and allowed him to keep publishing (55 issues between 1991 and 2004). As the series continued on, it grew in fame and prestige, until in 2005 it was picked up by Scholastic books, and released through their new imprint. At this time it is one of the highest selling graphic novel series of all time, beating out all the superhero releases since the 1940’s to present day.\n\nWithout a supportive community, this project wouldn’t see the light of day, nor be given the space to continue and finally achieve the great success it deserves. The Nouns community can allow the same to happen with NounsComics, giving any project created a chance to grow and incubate until the world has a chance to enjoy it.\n\nSend 175ETH ($210,000.00) ETH equivalent to Gnosis Safe to be converted into USDC.

I will be tapping into WEB3SG presence; one of the largest NFT twitter community in Singapore for this activation/promotion of Nouns Booth @ COMEX Singapore\n\n**FUNDS BREAKDOWN**\n|Description|Cost in USD*|Cost in ETH**|Cost in ETH***|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|COMEX booth (4x Days activation)<br><br> Includes:<br> - Designing of booth, having a feature wall<br> for photo opportunity<br> - Setting up / Tearing down / Dispoal <br> - 1x Information counter<br> - 1x TV screen to display live auction<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ COMEX virtual gallery<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ Artnow gallery<br>- 1x Tweet by WEB3SG to promote Nouns Booth<br>- 1x Twitter space to promote Nouns Booth|12,000|10.00|7.50|\n|Noggle Stickers (5,000pcs)|500|0.42|0.31|\n|Pins (1,000pcs)|1,500|1.25|0.94|\n|Tote Bags (500pcs)|900|0.75|0.56|\n|Brochure (2500pcs)|200|0.17|0.13|\n|Socks (500pcs)|800|0.67|0.50|\n|Shirt (500 pcs)|1,900|1.58|1.19|\n|Operations:<br> - 2x manpower for 4 days|4,000|3.33|2.50|\n|Transportation|300|0.25|0.19|\n|Total|22,100|18.42|13.81|\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\n*Base on local vendor price converted to USD\n**Considering an ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD due to possible fluctuations\n***Considering current ETH avg. price of 1,600 USD\n\n**SUMMARY**\nThis will be a great opportunity to create a Nounish IRL experience which is spread across 4 days of activation at one of the largest most anticipated annual event in Singapore; an opportunity to have Nouns branding reach out to a wider audience. \n\nAs COMEX is held on 1-4th Sep, this gives me a timeline of around 1 month. If proposal is able to pass and fund received within this week, majority of the funds will be converted to fiat as outlay for manufacturing Nounish goodies, remaining funds will be transfer to WEB3SG (ETH) as payment for the booth space at COMEX. I have already designed and created the files for the booth, thus I can pass them to WEB3SG who will manufacture and erect the booth. I will focus on overseeing the process as well as focusing on execution and administrative work prior to COMEX. \n\n\n**LONG TERM GOAL**\nI will continue to grow Nouns Singapore community under @nounsinsg, with Nouns Booth as the initiate activation. Nounsinsg will serve as a proliferation pod, guidance and point of contact for new contributor as well as creating more IRL Nounish experience in the future. Similar to Aubtoshi, a personal long-term goal is to officially be a Nouner. Until then, I will continue to proliferate Nouns in ways that are fun and effective that I can make possible. A IRL activation that I've been working on would be \"NOUNISH BEACH CLEAN UP' which was passed and supported by SMALL GRANT. (Thank you @noun22) It is scheduled on 13th Aug 2022, you may find more info and update on the event below. \n\nI want to thank all Nouners in advance for giving me the chance to contribute and proliferate Nouns together! \n\n**Transactions**\nGiven the time sensitivity of this proposal, the transaction embedded will send 15 ETH to the Small Grants multi-sig.  If this proposal seems likely to pass in early voting, Small Grants will release the funds to the proposer a few days in advance of the proposal being queued and executed.","endBlock":"15251623","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"9","id":"117","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"22","delegatedVotesRaw":"22","id":"0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":13}},{"createdTimestamp":"1658869449","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xf33ebc4b89a1e5fa437aae6ef25a8727094e1606"],"values":["144000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"388","startBlock":"15233541","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"38","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"63","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15220401","createdTransactionHash":"0x928dce024b6f040b46a6491817fc3f250e5ea5f6d8f8f3120cfdf0e8150760fa","description":"# NounsDAO Brazil\n\n# tl;dr\nBuild a community to nounify Brazil ⌐◨-◨\n \n# Description\n \nNounsDAO Brazil seeks to introduce Nouns in the diverse cultural manifestations that provide identity and tell the story of our country.

It is also crucial to onboard those who might not be able to overcome language barriers by distributing content and organizing events in the native language, Portuguese. With that in mind, we are proposing Nouns Week, an event in four capital cities. Our web content can also reach people living in eight other countries besides Brazil. Over 260 million people (3.7% of the world's population) speak Portuguese, the fourth most used language after Mandarin, English, and Spanish.\n\n# What have we done so far? (track record)\n\n1. A contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to nounify Brazilian symbols and memes, offering a prize to three winners. There were 23 submissions, great engagement and a lot of fun. \n![Winners](https://i.postimg.cc/4yXBpKcv/Cqr-Fl-Dd-Imgur.jpg)\n2.

It will use a delegated treasury to look for outsized opportunities within esports to continue proliferating Nouns with the best ROI possible. \n\n#### **Didn't we just pass an esports proposal?**\n- All of our esports proposals so far have been game-specific.\n- We have a very deep talent pool of esports native Nouners and Nounsfolk who can capably proliferate across a variety of titles.\n- Having quick access to funds will allow for better proliferation, as the competitive landscape has an ever-evolving calendar that makes the formal proposal process slow. \n- The pod has already been pitched multiple proposal ideas from high-level esports operators.\n    - Sending international players to the largest fighting game event.\n    - Sponsoring a high-level Dota LAN.\n    - Signing a League of Legends team.\n\n### **Esports Pod**\n- Consisting of Nouners and Nounsfok who are familiar with esports and aligned towards the mission of proliferation across the DAO. \n    - **Sasquatch** (Nouncil, Esports background)\n    - **Brennen** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Maty** (Nouncil)\n    - **Oni** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Brian Cho** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Jason Oliver** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Deeze** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **thebeautyandthepunk** (Nouner) \n    - **Brax** (Esports background)\n    - **PPD** (Esports background)\n    - **Griff** (Esports background)\n\n#### **Pod Structure** \n- The structure of the pod will be flexible, this means members can be added/removed based on a supermajority vote.\n- Upon initial deployment, the pod will functionally operate inside of the Nouns Esports Discord server.\n- Members of the Pod will vote over each proposed use of funds.\n    - Any member can sponsor a proposal.\n- A multi-sig consisting of Sasquatch, Brennen, Maty, Brian Cho, and Oni will operate funds.\n- All use of funds will be documented in a manner transparent to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Budget: 369 ETH**\n- This budget will be governed by the members of the Esports Pod and controlled by a 3/5 multi-sig. \n    - Address: [0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1)\n- For operational purposes, we will keep a portion of the standing budget as the stablecoin DAI.\n- Distribution:\n    - Proposals (~90%)\n    - Operations (max 10%) -  We've already had a broad range of contributions, any compensation related to those efforts (outside of individual proposals) will have to be voted on internally and awarded retroactively.\n        - Running weekly meetings, onboarding esports operators into Nouns, Discord & Twitter management, building the prop, multiple people taking calls and evaluating pitches, etc. \n        - May explore using Coordinape.\n#### **Potential Use of Funds**\n- Flexible funding towards infrastructure costs for each team we sign to Nouns Esports.\n    - Bootcamps, logistics, special events. \n- Sponsoring additional players, streamers, or teams.\n    - Each game is its own vertical to build within.\n- Funding Projects:\n    - Nouns Network\n        - We see the talent network at Nouns to be one of the best features to leverage as we grow.  These projects may already be independently funded, we would have standing budget available to work with them in an esports capacity.\n            - Examples:\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish) (Prop 64) - Filming our players at events, advising on marketing strategy.\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nouns Brand](https://twitter.com/nounsbrand) (Prop 109) - Designed outfits for the players at events, merch for fans.\n                - Nouns Esports x [NOUNS ON THE GROUND](https://twitter.com/nounsotg) (Prop 110) - Sending the Proliferation Pod to events our teams compete in.\n                - Supporting an Esports [Prop House](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse).\n    - Event Sponsorships\n        - Outsized opportunities to have high brand exposure through streaming or physical events.\n    - Streamers, Pros, or Casters with AR or Physical Noggles.\n    - Creating gamer Noggles with blue light filter.\n    - Creating team jerseys for players and fans.\n- Forking Nouns to create an esports-specific subDAO\n    - Designs created to represent games we participate in.\n### **Future**\n- Sustainability\n    - We believe Nouns Esports inherently works to proliferate the Nouns brand, but we are still interested in exploring a path towards creating a self-sustaining sub-community. \n    - Pillars this could be built on:\n        - Forking Nouns\n            - Exploring a subDAO mechanic which allows for fans to engage with the team at a greater level than existing esports organizations.\n        - Sponsors\n            - Traditional web2 sponsors.\n            - Web3 sponsors that the DAO chooses to affiliate with.\n        - Nouns Esports in-game items\n\n### **Testimonials**\n\n> e-sports has been one of the highest ROI proposals (in terms of attention generated) thus far...the success of nouns e-sports clearly demonstrates the power of handing the reigns to the community\n -[Nounder 4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1544800982399438849)\n\n>  I was a bit skeptical at first I'll admit but it was our Dota team that got my brother (a perennial crypto skeptic) to go from \"all NFTs are a scam\" to \"all NFTs except for Nouns are a scam\" ... which to me felt big\n -[Nouncillor brianj](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/943943469821476944/996129684200894526)\n \n > One of the reasons why I bought a noun was because I saw the positive impact that the nounsesports was creating to the greater gaming community...watching the dota 2 esports community (hardcore pc gamers) embrace the nouns ⌐◨-◨ meme has been incredible\n-[Nouner Brian Cho](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1543411851907645440)\n\n> Nounsesports was how I first learned about nouns and was really impressed with how the group was able to resonate with a hardcore gaming audience such as pro Dota 2 fans. Given my background helping to build esports at Riot and then as a board director at Astralis, I’m a big believer that esports helps gamers turn their love for games into part of their broader identity.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate **9ETH** (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\nAdditionally, we request **2ETH** in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\n\n**Proposal**\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n- $30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n- Fitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185.  Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n- Fitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n- Vision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n- Initial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\n- At that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n- Based on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\n- In order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity.  Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.\n\n**Noun Frames**\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\n\n**About Fitz:**\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/ \nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\n https://vimeo.com/377468371 \n\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html \n\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415 \n\n**About Vision 2 Learn:**\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/ \n","endBlock":"13480169","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"20","id":"12","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xae7f458667f1b30746354abc3157907d9f6fd15e","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1658979567","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0xc8598168d8475133de3150eff9b0ce27fb9b038d"],"values":["200000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"390","startBlock":"15241747","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"39","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"3","againstVotes":"130","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15228607","createdTransactionHash":"0x7bae79eb8ce01c239a85a19abdec8aa352646f34b524a96019d227e18dcbe7e0","description":"# NOUNS Wellness APP (iOS + Android)\n\n## NOUNS Wellness APP (iOS + Android)\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#who-said-mental-health-needs-to-be-boring-2)Who Said Mental Health Needs to Be Boring?\n\nNouns can be THE brand at the forefront of bringing wellness to young people worldwide in a playful, effective and engaging way.\n\nOur Mission: To Proliferate the Nouns Brand by Helping Kids Globally Who Are Suffering Mentally After the Global Pandemic – Free of Charge.\n\nWe challenged ourselves to design an initiative that prioritized improving overall mental and physical wellbeing irrespective of school, workplace and home settings. An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.\n\nWe have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#what-are-you-proposing-3)What Are You Proposing?\n\nNOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.\n\nThis proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.\n\nAnd also how this initiative is more than a good idea…\n\nIt’s potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS’ mission of goodwill.\n\nLET’S GO!\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-are-you-doing-it-4)Why Are You Doing It?\n\nMental health has never been more important post pandemic…\n\n-   …And this time it’s the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There’s a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.\n    \n-   Nouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone’s lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.\n    \n-   Nouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.\n    \n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-nouns-5)Why Nouns?\n\nSomething that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.\n\n-   As pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.\n-   And at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.\n\nIn a word… Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.\n\n(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6)How Is This Different to What’s Already out There?\n\nThe go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.\n\nThey also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.\n\nThis interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they’re not fun… Until NOUNS Wellness.\n\nAdditionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7)Who Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?\n\nAs established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.\n\nAmong these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‘cool’ resources for kids’ wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.\n\nAdditionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.\n\nIn short it’s not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact – creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.\n\nWe also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT’s and Crypto.\n\nBeyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness. We see Nouns Wellness as contributing toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#whos-creating-it-8)Who’s Creating It?\n\nWe’re two dads from Australia, and we are also two highly successful Web2 startup founders who have been in crypto since 2017.

This show would be CC0.**\n\n# **DESCRIPTION**\n**We propose to create a pilot for *Nouns! An Animated Series*.** \n*Nouns! An Animated Pilot* is a 2D tradigital animated 11-minute episode as seen in the [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70). The show is an animated comedy following the surreal adventures of best friends balancing the desire for mature adulthood and their reluctance to grow up.\n\n# **We propose doing a pilot in 3 phases.**\n**1) Script and Casting (weeks 1-6)** **$150K** \n*-1st milestone Deliver Script Tk01 Draft (End of Week 3)*\n**2) Animatic (weeks 4-11) $200K** \n*-2nd milestone Deliver Storyboards (End of Week 9)*\n**3) Final Animation (weeks 10-16) $150K** \n\nWe are targeting the schedule for ~16 weeks. However, we may need some flexiblity and increase the time it takes to deliver the pilot to ensure we can put out the best product possible.\nIf we start at the beginning of August, we can deliver before the year end.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mKXuW47.jpg)\n\n## **Phase 1: Scripting and Casting** \nThis phase would last for four-six weeks.\nDuring this phase we would work on the outline, script, script revisions and cast the episode.\nStart Date: **08/01/22** \n\n## **Phase 2: Preproduction**\nStarting week 4, we would begin Phase 2.\nThis phase would last seven weeks.\nDuring this phase, we will thumbnail, and storyboard, refine character designs, and backgrounds, create digital puppets and record scratch tracks and audio.\nStart Date: **08/22/22**\n\n## **Phase 3: Production/ Post**\nStarting week 10, we would begin Phase 3.\nThis phase is where the actual animation begins, with compositing, editing, and putting the final touches on everything.\nStart Date: **10/03/22**\n\n# **TOTAL ASK:**\n**~Ξ320 or ($500K USD)** to fund the creation of Nouns! An Animated Pilot. \n*The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC to ensure we have funding to cover production costs.*\n\n**MULTISIG**\nThe proposed budget + Ξ1 to cover gas fees will be released in ETH to a 3 of 4 multisig with signers **JoelCares**, **ToadyHawk**, **Benbodhi** and **thepencil.eth**. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.\n\n**Multisig address:**\n0x3D2268fa80B76448A8b33d554A3E972f5d8d5534\n\n**Phases to be funded at the commencement of each phase.

Artists' short-term freelance rates are higher than longer-term employment rates. There are also discounts on software subscriptions for longer-term commitments.\n\n# **WHY IS THIS UNIQUE?**\nIn developing *Nouns! An Animated Series*, the mission of *Person Place Thing Studios* is to share, inspire, and empower people around the globe through CC0 storytelling.\n\nAs paid professionals in the animation space, we aim to modernize the animation studio and pipeline by no longer requiring industry talent to be tethered to an antiquated studio system, a specific geographic location, or a traditional network distribution model.\n\nWe plan to hire best-in-class artists and designers, make broadcast-quality Nounish content at an accelerated pace, and proliferate Nouns to a worldwide audience via the internet.\n\n# **WHAT IS THE TONE OF THE SHOW?**\n*Nouns! An Animated Series* draws from similar humor and animation quality as *The Regular Show* and *Adventure Time*.  We want to create shows that make us laugh!  Our cast of characters are goofballs!  They escalate simple situations into ridiculous adventures that are filled with unpredictable twists and turns. They rarely solve their problems but always end with a laugh!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD WE BACK THIS?**\n- Bringing Nouns to life through animation is the next leap in introducing these characters to the mainstream culture of all ages.\n- Distributing on Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, etc, allows Nouns to reach an enormous audience.\n- Casting top talent as the voices of our characters will bring known celebrities to the world of Nouns and generate larger social media awareness and traditional media buzz.\n- Developing episodes in the 11-minute format also opens the door to legacy media distribution.\n\n# **BENEFITS TO THE DAO**\n- We love the Nouns characters and are dying to see them come to life!\n- Pilot episode will be CC0!\n- Cartoons are a great source of memeonic content; our show will create many shareable clips that can help with the mission of proliferation.\n- Cartoons are also a great invitation to a much wider and younger audience. \n- There will be new nounish content made and shared every day!\n- Having an animated show will add value to other extensions in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- Through Discord, the DAO will be an active participant in the creative process.\n- Any profits obtained will be reinvested in the studio to make additional Nouns animated content.\n- *Person Place Thing Studios* can be utilized in the creation of content for future DAO Proposals (episodic cartoons, commercial endeavors, music videos, shorts, etc)(i.e. The Greidiens pitch gets sold to a network, rather than having to shop around looking for a studio to work with we would already be set up to handle their needs.)\n- As educators, we will be inviting and sending the CC0 assets to schools for their students to use as they learn animation while creating nounish content.\n\n# **WHO ARE THE CREATIVES?**\n\n**Sam Ellis:**\nSam Ellis (Person) makes comics, cartoons, and games (Things) although he has also helped create a few people as well. He has worked for a myriad of comic publishers, animation, and game studios in a variety of positions from LA to Atlanta (Places). Some of his past projects have been: *Archer, Adventure Time, Bravest Warriors, The Awesomes, Frisky Dingo, Catbug*, and more.\n\n**Jason Shwartz:**\nJason Shwartz is an Emmy-nominated Director with extensive experience in broadcast television production and direction. He has directed broadcast shows for *Netflix, [adultswim], Comedy Central, Hulu, 20th Century Fox, SyFy, AppleTV, IFC, FX, and Disney*.  He has produced original animated content for social games with companies including *Disney Interactive, Marvel, ESPN, and Garfield*.\n\nJason has worked on popular television shows including *Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Wolfboy and the Everything Factory, Squidbillies, The Masked Singer, Paradise Police Department, Lazor Wulf, The Awesomes*, and more!\n\n**Previous accomplishments in the proliferation of Nouns:**\n- [Co-developed NounsTown, an extension project of Nouns introducing PFD (profile deeds) A profile picture that proves ownership of land in the metaverse](https://nounstown.wtf/), and a [Nouns Auction Tracker](https://nounstown.wtf/tracker).\n- Brought and showcased Nounish extensions into the metaverse via BLOCKS giving the ability to make user-generated content easy to share, such as 3D Nouns and other projects.\n- [Active Nouncil member that regularly participates in voting](https://nouncil.wtf/)\n- [Active participant and on the organizing committee for The Noun Square (A group of nounish builders hosting daily celebrations around Noun O’Clock)](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock)\n- Introduced Samsung to Nouns (through Joey at Buoy Studio) which lead to their video in Times Square and 837X DCL experience.\n- [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kamhh0c.jpg)\n\n# **PITCHBOOK:**\n*Below are attached parts of the pitchbook from Prop 70, we thought rather than attaching all the pages we would just attach a few.* \n**The outlines, character bios, and their designs will be further developed if funded.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nPySACM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OOerzzy.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n8f0qi3.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UDAn6Zw.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FtnmcAD.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW3qMnG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iSAAAiX.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0lvXKtH.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIPUSz.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S4Y0uQl.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v3tPsar.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pKfvpDI.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xvRZ4b4.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9TGaTG9.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0VVEX0M.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wd2ngDd.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HpaAM1z.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CuMar4K.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m8NXn8N.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2U1AyiE.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gsEEIlO.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eqrbhiM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ua8N87m.png)","endBlock":"15267164","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"27","id":"121","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"12","delegatedVotesRaw":"12","id":"0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":9}},{"createdTimestamp":"1659059345","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0x24e302de82089d3eaf4d961b1d1b1f55b4fefb12"],"values":["50000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"390","startBlock":"15247687","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"39","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"3","againstVotes":"72","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15234547","createdTransactionHash":"0x77c26be9b4239832fa0e60d5b7352599e28150a69796ac92529a6361fdeb99cc","description":"# Nouns Jokedao Grant\n\nDiscourse link: [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-jokedao-for-nouns/1836](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-jokedao-for-nouns/1836)\n\n## Description\n\njokedao has built the first on-chain, bottom-up governance platform for communities to submit proposals and vote on their favorites; it enables community-set governance for user-generated roadmaps, grants, endorsements, bounties, curation, and contests.\n\nOne of the major benefits of on-chain voting is that it can allow for extensible contracts—that is, transactions that automatically execute depending on the results of a vote. For example, a community could vote on who to receive funds or what NFT to buy or even mint, and depending on the result of the vote, the transaction would be executed.\n\nMore excitingly, it also enables composable governance that could combine different transactions. For example, a community could vote on different features for an NFT, and the top three options could be combined to mint a unique image reflecting the different votes.\n\nExtensible contracts would enable a whole new generation of projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nSome examples, please: how will this proliferate Nouns?\n\nWe imagine Nouns forks in the future won’t simply replicate Nouns but develop unique minting and auction mechanisms of their own to innovate on the Nouns playbook—not simply its art, but its model.\n\nHere are a few examples of Nouns forks that jokedao could enable through extensible contracts:\n\nCreate-a-Noun. Communities could submit and vote on the different properties of a Nouns that could then be automatically generated to incorporate each of the individual qualities.\n\nUser-generated Nouns. Enable NFT-derived voting power so that communities could create interactive Nouns projects in which the holders of NFTs could collectively submit and vote on the design of each subsequent NFT.\n\nNouns governance giveaways. Every 10th Noun (derivative) could be given away to a member of the community who had voted on the most winning options in the previous 9 contests, in order to incentivize voting and reward those who build social consensus with a community to vote on winning options.\n\nNouns governance rewards. Rewards (NFTs, Poaps, tokens, portions of the treasury, etc.) could be given away to those who have voted consistently in Nouns proposals in order to incentivize active participation.\n\nOn-chain Nouns Grants. jokedao could collaborate with Prop House to enable fully on-chain and open-source grants for communities to use to incentivize builders to develop their NFT universe.\n\n## Context\n\njokedao started as a Nouns fork through its proof-of-concept, the jokerace—a weekly contest in which the community of $JOKE holders votes on the 2nd best joke of the week, which is minted as an NFT that’s sold on a recurring basis. It is likely the first case in which an NFT collection was fully community-created. Since launching in the spring, the jokerace has regularly drawn around 100 weekly players who return each week, consistently sold NFTs, and incentivized the creation of teams that compete. In other words, as a DAO, it’s organically incentivized the creation of subDAOs without input or management from the core team.\n\nSince then, jokedao has built a platform with scaffold eth for creating and running contests by minting voting tokens and sharing them with communities. Currently 8 EVM-compatible chains are supported so communities can deploy contests and voting tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. We are relaunching with clean, beautiful UI in a few weeks.\n\nProjects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already use jokedao for contests with their community, and jokedao has soft commits from about another dozen projects in the space to use it for governance after the site relaunch—many of these are NFT projects looking to give their communities more ways to collectively create NFTs themselves. Other popular use cases include grants, giveaways, and content creators letting their communities tell them what kind of content to create.\n\nFinally, let’s emphasize that neither bottom-up nor on-chain governance have been unlocked in NFTs or DAOs to date. Projects typically give few avenues for their communities to express their ideas or cocreate beyond approving proposals of a core team. And on-chain governance has been prohibitive due to gas fees until the past few months.\n\nBoth of these unlock exciting opportunities for DAOs and NFT projects to create far more inclusive and incentivized communities—as we’ve seen with both Nouns and the jokerace.\n\n## Why?\n\nNouns is unique among NFT projects for a number of reasons—but perhaps most of all that it’s the only NFT project with the means and model to incentivize builders to develop its ecosystem’s value through forks, homages, expansion packs, and next-generation projects. No other NFT project has this.\n\nJokedao’s thesis is that the next wave of NFTs and DAOs will be far more interactive and community-governed than this last wave—which has primarily seen centralized figures appealing to consumers to support them, rather than to actively cocreate. Nouns has shown the strongest evidence of this trend, and it seems clear that the next generation of NFT DAOs will go further in letting their communities compete, team up, and create as fun forms of gamified governance. Nouns is in the best position to support these projects within its own ecosystem to grow its value, and jokedao would love to team up to make it happen.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nExtensible contract module: enabling contests to automatically execute transactions depending on the result of a vote\nCreator submission control: enabling only contest creators to submit options for a community to choose from (avoiding user-generated code that may have issues)\nComposable contracts: enabling different winning votes to be combined, for example to combine different properties of a Nouns into a new NFT\nCore Team\n\nDavid Phelps is a 2x SaaS founder who cofounded ecodao, created a web3 angels collective (cowfund), advises TCG Crypto, is a Gitcoin Steward, and writes on web3 on his substack and twitter 1.

His face appears on posters all over Paris and has been since 2001. Often found next to Invader or M. CHAT, John is a mystery and a joke in the art world. His motto is 'It is the promotion that makes the artist or the zero degree of art.' Recently, John has shown a lot of interest developing ideas around AR and Metaverse/NFTs. He has reached out to Coralorca after a Twitter follow, and they talked about doing some nounish things together, starting with a noggles campaign.   \n## VALUE PROPOSITION\nIt is interesting for NounsDAO to position themselves along something mysterious that comes from the streets, from the art world, and support artists while doing so. People will notice the glasses and wonder what it all means, it will trigger their imagination and curiosity. On top of that, France has a strong Web3 community that will surely notice. \n## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nA total of 1000 wheat posters and John will change his PFP on twitter and instagram during the campaign. \n500 posters 70*100cm in Paris, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n250 posters 70*100cm in Marseille, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n250 70*100cm in Lyon, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n+ a bonus projection on the BNF (National French Library) similar to picture below\n![Artist Projection Mockup](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonBNF.png)\nJohn will make sure this is well documented with short movies and pictures. I also have contacts in Paris if we need additional videos.\nSome quick mockups by the artist:\n![Artist Mockups](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonMockups.png)\nRegarding legality: the posters will be placed on tolerated areas like construction sites, public poster boards etc And the circular ones will be placed where there are already a few invaders and other street artists, where it is tolerated.\nCoral Orca will organize a street marketing campaign next to the posters with chalk stencils. We decided to have the noggles in different colors as well and not show any website url - keep it mysterious for now. \nJohn will also post on his instagram account about the campaign and modify his profile picture to add the nouns glasses.\n## LINKS\nhttps://www.instagram.com/john_hamon/ (250K followers)\nhttps://www.compulsivecontents.com/detail-event/the-mysterious-face-of-paris/\n## PROJECT TIMELINE\nEnd of August 2022 for Marseille.\nSeptember-October 2022  for Paris and Lyon (When everyone in France is back to the city to work)\n## TEAM\nJohn Hamon https://twitter.com/johnhamon_ \nCoral Orca https://twitter.com/coralorca \n## COMPENSATION\nWe are asking for a total of 22 ETH - 15 for John and his team, 5.5 for the stencil campaign, and 1.5 for Coral Orca for organizing it. \n## TRANSACTIONS\n15 ETH to 0xbb3844536bcb17c20b36da2ec20f90a03865c945\n7 ETH to 0x8833Db8110D54c5632B67b83441AccbdA5B23bF4\n\n","endBlock":"15314923","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"157","id":"126","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x7dd5b92716542ab2442030df6d87cec437a51ded","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":-1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1660014067","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"CANCELLED","targets":["0xbe04bdd360faee5a3cfc407c4cd3325c24bde8b9"],"values":["82000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"403","startBlock":"15318620","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"40","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"31","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15305480","createdTransactionHash":"0x1ab876d015e762de4146293ebb5bbaf09f2d96531d05465f8265648901b4a956","description":"# Nouns x Dopamine\n\ntl:dr: Dopamine & Apenoun propose to collaborate on a limited-supply Nounish non-fungible streetwear drop to be released at the Dopamine product launch event at Art Basel Miami in December. Funds requested are ~62Ξ - 82Ξ, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.\n\n\n![dopamine1|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fcb654ffb-1fbf-439e-9acd-16fed749523b%2FIMG_01.jpg?table=block&id=4d66b37a-86ae-48a7-adc2-6c620f477466&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n\n[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is a Nouns-fork with the mission to empower empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through the world’s first community-owned ecosystem for non-fungible streetwear. We are homegrown web3 natives aiming to bridge the gap between streetwear & crypto culture.\n\nInspired by Nouns DAO, our membership structure has a Nounish distribution, and we’ll be kicking off our auctions later this year. Holders of Dopamine Membership NFTs determine the creative direction of Dopamine, in addition to revenue sharing and perks at our IRL events.\n\nAs a streetwear-focused web3 project our goal is to bridge the divide between the physical and digital worlds. Though we recognise the growing market for digital-only fashion, as Hypebeasts who tend to spend [an insane amount of money](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/streetwear-supreme-fans-spending-habits/) on streetwear and [sneakers](https://stockx.com/news/sneakerheads-spend-10-of-income-on-kicks/#), we love our physical pieces and really couldn’t live without them.\n\nIn contrast to a project like RTFKT for example we are physical-first, meaning that upon physical delivery of our garments, customers must scan a microchip to authenticate ownership, after which they will receive the bundled NFTs.\n\nIt’s undeniable that NFTs have unleashed a new cultural revolution, putting the creative power in the hands of digital artists, musicians, and photographers, and creating an exploding market for digital collectibles. This is the energy we want to bring to streetwear.\n\nSo we’re taking the best of both worlds as physicals take us off our screens and bring us together through something tactile, while NFTs unlock a new world with limitless creative possibilities.\n\nThe Dopamine Team is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-inspired non-fungible streetwear bundle for the Dopamine Marketplace launch at Art Basel Miami. With this collab we hope to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture.\n\n\n## **Non-Fungible Streetwear Bundles**\n\nThe main product Dopamine offers partners are limited-edition “non-fungible streetwear bundles” consisting of these parts:\n\n- The physical streetwear piece embedded with the Dopamine microchip.\n- The “physical-bound NFT” (PNFT), a digital 3D model of the piece, forever cryptographically bound to the microchip.\n- “Accessory NFTs”, which could include digital art, represent brand loyalty or event perks, or any other creative expression partners wish to include in the bundle.\n\n![dopamine2|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F75a968c0-03ba-467c-8271-032bd8679892%2FScreenshot_2022-08-01_at_12.07.54.png?table=block&id=0876c198-98e2-4ea3-bd2a-816177363ff5&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n\n## **Dopamine Studio Curation**\n\nDopamine Studio is the one-stop shop for brands and creators to create Non-Fungible Streetwear either from scratch or by bundling their already existing merchandise. \n\nThis product is intended to be released nearing Q1, providing a Manifold-like experience to end-to-end collection curation made specially for streetwear.

Spearheaded by [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk), [Ser Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz) and [Noun 142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo), administered by a talented committee of Nounish builders, and supported by a growing international community.\n\nAfter a two week unpaid experiment, plus a one month funded trial ([Prop 101](https://nouns.wtf/vote/101)), we believe we have proven our worth to the Nouns ecosystem, both as a daily touchpoint for the community, and as a powerful onboarding tool for Nouns-curious passers-by the world over. We are requesting funding to continue running and growing the show for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year.\n\n## Accomplishments\n* **58 Consecutive Daily Spaces**, none missed. \n* **A 24-hour Twitter Space** for the nouniverse with over 60 Nounish guests and 1,400+ attendees from all over the world (attendance never dropped below 100 unique listeners all night and day.)\n* **3 successful Coordinape Rounds** completed, awarding USDC to a total of 12 unique contributing members. Pioneering completely decentralized rewards-based compensation based loosely on Nouncil model. **Average compensation per contributor $1,500 USDC per round.**   \n* **120 Daily Attendees on average**, with some shows as high as 400.\n* **Surpassed our metrics** for the entire one month trial in just 2 weeks, and have now in some cases doubled expectations.\n\n\n### Our Stated Goals from Proposal 101\nScreenshot from Prop:\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-07-19-at-4-59-28-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4dbt6VBr/Screen-Shot-2022-07-19-at-4-59-28-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/62qyw2s0)\n\n### Our Actual Metrics to Date:\n\n* 1.2M Tweet Impressions(!!) (More than 2X of goal)\n* 1,750 Followers (1.5X goal)\n* Average attendance: 120 per day \n* FOMO players: average 50 per day\n* 1,650 Contest Entries (2X of goal)\n\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-08-09-at-4-12-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPHTSfFF/Screen-Shot-2022-08-09-at-4-12-11-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/9rYrbXF1)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SINfRWV.png)\n\n\n\n\n### We Also Achieved All Broader Goals from Prop 101\n\n[![broad-goals-check.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d1SJ4cm8/broad-goals-check.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wyLKjPrv)\n\n## Amazing Nounish Content\n\n### Engaging Contests\n* **6 weeks+ of consecutive contests**: awarded over 11 ETH in prizes to creative and talented Nounsfolk. Contests have resulted in over 1,650 unique pieces of user-created Nounish art/content so far, and has spawned at least 3 individual Nounish art collections.\n\n[![nounish-cloud.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/N0Zrqbzh/nounish-cloud.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/R3Q0w1mG)\n\n* Among the winning entries of these contests have been some truly incredible pieces of art, including this Watercolor Cloud Noun by [Jheeart_NFT](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft). \n    * We helped this artist to create a collection \"With Noun\" using Manifold, and release the piece as an NFT (which sold for 0.69!) and she is releasing more pieces in the same style, [you can see the collection here.](https://opensea.io/collection/withnoun)  \n* **Our show has become an efficient marketing tool** to discover and recruit new artists & builders for Nouns DAO. With contests we are able to identify top talent and funnel it to Small Grants or Prop House to onboard to building for Nouns!\n\n### Some Other Example Contest Entries \n\n*Contest entry from Yujujae 유주재 ⌐ⓝ°ⓒ 청어*\n[![yacht-club-conetest.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xqVqMNyB/yacht-club-conetest.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/BPNqG6zC)\n\n\n*Nouniversary contest entry by Jhee:* [![jhee-nouniversary.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/hhRRp9Yb/jhee-nouniversary.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hQsYG7cf) \n\n*Nouniversary contest entry by Skwalo691*\n[![clock-contest-entry.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/pdzGJwH7/clock-contest-entry.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/QBNJXnVk)\n\n*This physical oil painting contest entry from Sasohan*\n[![van-gogh-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bN49Vm3j/van-gogh-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8dG8d9C)\n\n### Awesome Guests\n\nDeezeFi (twice), David Horvath, Taco Noun, Salvino, Oni, Messhup, Brennen, Grammy-winning Musician Violetta Zironi (who performed live), Stoopid Buddy, Jack Butcher and more.\n\n### A Platform for Builders\n\nWe provide a live and engaged audience for builders to update the audience on the progress of their projects. This is a very effective way for builders to get attention to their work.\n\n### FOMO Engagement: Just Look At Those Nouns\nThrough increased FOMO engagement, we have helped mint some truly beautiful Nouns (including an incredible triple Void run!)\n\n[![sexy-nouns.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/TPyq8KQs/sexy-nouns.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/CZgfkL3C)\n\n### Using POAPs to Gamify Participation and Give a Platform to Artists\n\nWe have given a daily POAP to attendees of The Noun Square every day since our inception. This is the purest use case for the protocol, and works well for us to incentivize people to attend our Twitter spaces, play FOMO live and participate in our contests. \n\nAdditionally, this has allowed us to feature the art of talented established artists like Ser Noadz, Sam Ellis, SuperTightWoody and Greta Grempllin, as well as giving exposure to talented new creators like [0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1555013482222870528?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw), [Illustradora.eth](https://twitter.com/ilustradoraeth/status/1556418817244422144?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw) and [Leetlestar](https://twitter.com/hapsigmi/status/1556802875111550976?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw). \n\nWe also plan to continue to use the data from these POAP distributions in the future to do token-gated raffles and contests that reward past participants and strengthen our community.\n\n## Bonus Things We've Done That We Didn't Even Say We'd Do\n\n* **24-hour Nouniversary Celebration**: an audacious [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1556348069662412802) on the Nouniversary with dozens of guests booked, contests, games and more. \n    * Over 1,400+ unique attendees, attendance never dropped below 100 at any time.\n    * 50+ Nounish guests\n    * Amazing community shared moments.\n* **Nounish NFT collections:** We have helped community members to set up Nounish NFT collections based on their Noun Square contest entries using Manifold. \n* **International outreach:** We have done outreach to international audiences by hosting non-English Spaces on some Saturdays, and making foreign-language channels in Discord with moderation.\n* **Community involvement in DAO governance:** Noun 142 Delegated his Noun to The Noun Square multisig so that we could initiate an Audience Voting initiative. \n    * We invite proposers to pitch their proposals to the audience.\n    * The audience then votes live in our discord.\n    * We then execute the voted on-chain accordingly. \n    * This has been a popular segment, and we look forward to expanding on the experiment in future.\n\n\n## The Future of the Noun Square\nWe hope the above sections paint a clear picture of all the accomplishments our team has achieved over the past 6 weeks, meeting or exceeding all the engagement goals we set for ourselves in Prop 101. \n\nThe Purpose of this Proposal is to ask the DAO to fund our proven team for an additional 5 months, until the end of the calendar year, to do the following:\n\n* **Continue to plan and execute daily Twitter Spaces**: Engage newcomers, Nouners and Nouns community members alike, with informative guests and fun contests that produce a plethora of Nouns-based art and authentic social media engagement.\n* **Continue to organize Contests for our community**: Using data from our trial, we have found that 1-2 weekly contests with larger prizes are both more effective and less administratively onerous compared to daily contests. We would plan to move forward with 1-2 contests per week with prizes ranging from 0.05-1ETH, which will no doubt encourage more thoughtful and skillful entries (while also peppering in smaller contests live on the show for variety.)  \n* **Innovate on contest voting and prize administration:** We have spoken with Nounder Seneca and, if funded, plan to move forward with an implementation of **Prop House** for our contest entries to be voted on weekly, as an alternative to the current system of emoji voting in Discord. \n* **Work with the [Noun O'Clock Web App](https://prop.house/proposal/777) team:** Iterate with the team to ship a product with product-market fit and integrate these clients with our own site and daily Spaces as much as possible. \n\n### Areas of Focus\n\nOur vision for TNS in the next 5 months:\n\n* **International growth:** As we enter a European/APAC friendly Noun O Clock, we want to seize the opportunity to introduce Nouns to these regions of the world even more than we already have been.\n* **Be a leading onboarding funnel to Nouns:** We have seen initial signs that our show is a great vehicle to onboard artists, builders, and future Nouners to the DAO. We want to lean into this and make sure our show becomes a strong funnel into nouns.\n* **Expand to new channels:** We want to explore growth opportunities via new channels like podcast platforms, Youtube, TikTok and Twitch.\n* **The Noun Square as a platform for builders:** We want to keep attracting talent to build on top of our show. Two teams ([NOC nouns client](https://prop.house/proposal/777) & [NOC Onboarding Materials](https://prop.house/proposal/864)) have already won prop house funding to build specifically on top of the Noun Square show, in addition to the previously mentioned artists whose collections have been prompted by our contests, and we hope to see more in the coming months.\n\n### So what does success look like at the end of 2022?\n* Grow our twitter followers from 1,600 to 5,000+\n* Average daily attendance by end of year 200+\n* 5,000+ contest entries\n* International growth: Our goal is to contribute to growing a much larger international noun ecosystem by end of year. We have already started this outreach and plan to continue with more foreign language \"takeover\" spaces on the weekends, and focus on non-English accessibility in Discord and Twitter.  \n\n\n### Budget\n\nMonthly Operations Costs: \n* **Contest Prizes:** 10 ETH\n* **Team Compensation and Administration:** 50 ETH per month, allocated by Committee Coordinape on a Biweekly basis.\n* **Time Period:** 5 months until end of 2022. \n* 5 x 60 ETH = 300 ETH\n**Total Proposal Ask: 300 ETH**\n(Cost of 3 Daily Nouns Auctions for 5 months of daily Nounish multimedia content and organic social media engagement.) \n\n\n### Team\n\nWe will continue with our \"3C Model\" of governance and accountability:\n\n**Core (Founding) Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n\nToady Hawk\nNoun 142\nSer Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\nAubtoshi\nBenbodhi\nSuperTightWoody\nRyanMac21\n!Xargs\nSam Ellis\nMaty.eth\nJoshua Fisher\n\n\n*Members of this committee may rotate depending on timezones, availability, etc. New incoming Committee members from APAC timezones will most probably include 0xigami, Goldy, Mr. Boney, Mintfaced, and more.*\n\n### Community (Talent Funnel for Council)\n\nAnyone in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VQxv2BFw39) and Twitter communities can join and participate in all our public channels to help with contest ideas, guest ideas, and more, and can apply to join the Organizing Committee at any time. We have forked Nouncil governance with procedures for adding/removing contributing committee members at any time. \n\nThe above organizational strategy (modeled loosely on Nouncil) allows us enough structure to execute on a daily basis, as well as enough flexibility to adapt to new timezones and other challenges as they may arise.\n\n\n## Strategy for North American \"Nouns Winter\"\n\nNOC happening during North American late night/early morning may have some impact on our attendance rate, although we have been attracting a sizable audience from Europe and Asia already (for example, during our recent 24H long Nouniversary Spaces, attendance never dropped below 100 even during NA non-peak hours.) Nonetheless, we think of this as an opportunity rather than a challenge: \n\n### Proliferation opportunity\n* Auction times drifting enable fairer distribution of nouns across the globe. **We think of our show drifting with NOC as giving a fairer opportunity for Noun proliferation outside of the Americas timezones**\n*  We will have the opportunity to **engage with international guests**, and introduce our nounish energy to a new audience. \n\n### Host Recruiting & Scaling Ops\n\n* **We have begun recruiting additional hosts** and administrative helpers from Europe and APAC timezones so that we can smoothly transition into North American night.\n* Several of our Committee members are also excited to continue hosting/attending the show well into the North American night. \n* We are **already pulling in an impressive daily audience from Europe, Australia and Asia** (especially Japan and Korea.) \n* We plan to work with members of NounsDAOJapan, NounsDAO Brazil and GnarsDAO (Australia based) to continue to pull in new viewers and new Nounsfolk even through the North American early morning hours.\n\n\n\n### New distribution channels\n\n* We will begin posting recordings of our daily spaces both on a **podcast server and on Youtube**, so that North American audiences will still be able to listen and interact with our content daily. \n* We will also experiment with doing trial versions of The Noun Square on **Youtube, Twitch, and TikTok Live** to test engagement on those mediums. \n\n### Scaling with systems\n* Our team has created a robust Notion for knowledge management with **Planning Documents, Tracking Databases and Daily Run-of-Show Templates** to enable onboarding of new hosts and contributors as easy and decentralized as possible.\n\n\n## LFG!\n\nWe were funded for a trial and have surpassed all goals and metrics by a large margin, going above and beyond with initiatives such as the 24 hour Nouniversary Spaces. \n\nWe represent a group of committed Nounish builders with a good track record of success, and we are asking for the DAO's trust, as we lean into a very successful concept and continue to improve, grow and scale this new platform centred around the daily Noun O' Clock. \n\nWe believe that in a short time, The Noun Square has become the defacto watercooler of the Nounish ecosystem, as well as an impressive funnel for new Noun owners, artists and builders. \n\nWe are excited by how much more we can do if given a mandate to keep on building throughout the remainder of 2022. \n\n**Thank you for your support, and we look forward to having you as a guest on the show one day soon!**","endBlock":"15343873","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"111","id":"128","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x5d802e2fe48392c104ce0401c7eca8a4456f1f16","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1660233883","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xff8eb6aa355b117746d779d5b2b71d0a9377421d"],"values":["33000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"406","startBlock":"15334795","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"40","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"1","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15321655","createdTransactionHash":"0x4b0c3bf6dc3c24d82cb65b7897f308d1903d480a7b34309ce96bc661bd0c01f6","description":"# Nounify New York Fashion Week\n\n![NOUNS1234.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa049a25e-253b-45f9-bb78-e973b8065703%2FNOUNS1234.png?table=block&id=bbedeb12-c914-4bf8-9218-8c3078a11340&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n*This is 0xBobatea, I'm submitting this proposal on behalf of my friends at Advisry:\n\nWe want to Nounify New York Fashion week! By branding and collaborating on Advisry’s official calendar runway show in September, we will introduce nouns to fashion in an illustrious way.\n\n**Why?**\n\nNouns has effortlessly aligned itself with all realms of high art. As a young fashion label, we are aware of the shift in culture and believe the Nouns Glasses logo is the Nike swoosh of web3. We feel it is necessary for Nouns to be represented in the most iconic facet of fashion culture, the fashion runway show.\n\n**Nouns x Advisry Experience**\n\nWhat Nouns is working towards in the future of web3 aligns closely with the overall goals of Advisry. Advisry and Nouns both strive to build communities to give individuals a voice and platform to express themselves and their ideas on a bigger scale. \n\nThe Advisry X Nouns experience involves “In Real Life” events that bring our conglomerates together to communicate the importance of unity and change. Advisry wants to involve web3 in fashion and continue aligning with Nouns on potential future projects. \n\n**How**\n\nTo Nounify the show and after party, we will:\n\n- Provide Advisry X Nouns POAPs to onboard show guests.\n- Provide Nouns gifts for every show guest.\n- Brand Nouns EVERYWHERE at the venue for the show and after party.\n- Include Nouns pieces & looks designed by Keith Herron on the runway.\n- Film a documentary of the process of Nounifying NYFW.\n\n**The Show**\n\nIn September Advisry will be showing their first womenswear collection at New York Fashion Week. The collection titled, “Masculin Feminin” aims to capture gender inclusivity through 32 looks of traditional and nontraditional womenswear. \n\n**Nouns On The Runway**\n\nAdvisry will include Nouns Sunglasses that will be featured in one of the looks in the runway show. Along with this, one of the models will graze the runway with the Nouns Soft Trunk. There will be two Nouns-themed looks in the show.\n\n![nouns soft trunk.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3f9c2296-0f88-4cad-9653-e37319381ee3%2Fnouns_soft_trunk.png?table=block&id=30217e74-922a-4901-9f78-9c2fe4257837&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**THE NOUNS SOFT TRUNK**\n\nThe soft trunk design is a reference and ode to custom Goyard and Gucci trunks made for their premier clients. They Screenprint their client’s names and or logos on the baggage to make them custom. The more thoughtful side of the design is the altering of the trunk itself - changing it from wooden frame structure to a more soft leather structure, similar to a luxury duffle. This trunk design is intended to be immediately iconic due to the pure crossover of a nouns logo with Advisry’s monogram print.\n\n- A classical trunk shape & hardware, but no wooden frame - it will be made of vegan leather with gold plated .925 silver hardware - structured so it will maintain shape\n- The classic Advisry checkerboard monogram will be embossed into the leather - the nouns glasses will be screenprinted on the bag\n- Made in Italy\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe show will take place in the *Oculus NYC*, an artistic landmark located at The World Trade Center. We will be the first of many fashion brands to utilize this as a show space, which is on its way to becoming one of the new homes of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe Oculus NYC is located in one of the most heavily foot trafficked areas in all of New York. The building is packed with many storefronts, an NJTransit & major MTA station hub, and was once even home to a Kanye West music video in 2019.  \n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fce2080fd-6ae6-4d01-b027-ba4995832001%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=d57f7ed1-c590-4088-8e11-a62f04b37034&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=1460&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd498554e-5c90-4cc2-a6cd-142be2f2c8ae%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=6aa96ec1-ce6d-4561-ae46-a754bac567bb&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**Set Production**\n\n- Dress the runway with Parisian style cafe chairs and tables where guests will be seated\n- Light the show with Parisian style street lamps that are manually operated to highlight models by turning on and off as they walk the runway\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**Fund Advisry to:**\n\n- Occupy the Oculus NYC space for the show and after party\n- Produce all garments and accessories for the show\n- Execute the set design of the show\n- Create collaborative pieces to seed and sell to Nouns new and growing audience of luxury consumers\n- Build out a team to produce, fabricate, style, cast, and model the *Masculin Feminin* Show\n- Brand Nouns throughout the venue using Vinyl, Signage, Video, and more\n\n**Branding**.\n\n- Nouns X Advisry T-shirt collaboration to be gifted and/or sold at the after party\n- Nouns branded drinks at the after party\n- Nouns signage and video being played throughout the venue\n- Nouns branding on all invites and Ads posted by Advisry\n\n**Billboard: a 60’ x 12’ Nouns billboard placed outside of the Oculus, designed by Advisry’s creative director, Keith Herron. This billboard will reach beyond our fashion week audience and be seen by the heavy traffic of tourists and locals walking through the historic Oculus Space.**  \n\nAccording to the City of New York data last updated on June 30 2022, the Oculus has an average foot traffic of 16,000 people per day\n\n**Documentation**\n\nWe want to create a documentary that captures behind the scenes footage of the Nounification of New York Fashion Week! \n\nTelling the story of how an IRL fashion show can be realized with a Nouns collaboration speaks to how valuable, versatile, and functional the DAO is. The documentary would be the first of its kind and a timeless piece in a world where web3 and the high arts will one day seamlessly grow and work together. \n\nWe would work to publish this documentary on a fashion youtube channel like Vogue, GQ, Etc. \n\n*We are interested in working with the creators of **Prop 73, Stoopid Buddy Doc** to film and produce the documentary but have not yet been in contact with them.* \n\n**How does this benefit Nouns**\n\nNew York Fashion Week is one of the most iconic and respected events in the global fashion industry. By working side by side we will transform the view of Nouns as not only having a “luxury” side of the brand with sunglasses and high quality garments, but also having a leg in the always changing industry of fashion.\n\nNouns holders in NYC will have the opportunity to place their name on our guest list for the runway show and all after parties using an alias to keep identities private.\n\nA multi-faceted branding opportunity that not only reaches the show audience but also the city of New York\n\n**Visibility**\n\nWith past coverage from Vogue, GQ, Forbes, WWD, CFDA, and more we believe we can bring Nouns to the forefront of fashion journalism. \n\nThese platforms will put Nouns on hundreds of thousands of peoples radar if not more. Vogue, GQ, and WWD alone average over 5 to 10 million monthly website viewers and have a combined following of over 100 million people on all of their social media platforms.\n\n**Why work with Advisry?**\n\nAdvisry is a fashion, film, and music label based in NYC. Keith Herron, 22 year old founder and designer, began Advisry when he was in 8th grade and has been growing the brand ever since. Keith has sold Advisry to 35 different countries, was awarded the Gucci Changemakers scholarship and was most recently added to the Designer’s Hub of CFDA: a members-only incubator of American Designers joining the likes of Marc Jacobs, Rick Owens, Virgil Abloh, and many more.\n\nLast spring Advisry debuted on the runway at NYFW. In his first live show, Keith designed 37 looks and packed out the venue with over 150 people in attendance. \n\nThe fashion industry is very gate kept. There is no actual way to break through the industry in an official way without working with a brand that has already broken through. Historically, the way brands get the opportunity to be on the official fashion calendar is by spending many seasons producing their own runway shows independent of the fashion calendar, hoping to gain the attention of the CFDA. \n\nThe benefit of collaborating with Advisry is it gives Nouns an authentic introduction and inclusion into the fashion industry. Not only is Advisry an up and coming line making a lot of noise for its unique approach, but the brand has also collaborated on web3 drops in the past. Keith was the designer of the Advisry X CreatureWorld clothing collection, one of the most successful physical web3 drops to date. \n\n**Collaborators**  \n\n- **Jean-Michel Basquiat Collaboration**\n\nAdvisry and [The Estate of Jean-Michel Basqiuat](https://www.basquiat.com/) are collaborating on 10 different pieces that will be debuted on the Advisry runway and be shown later on in the month at the Basqiuat museum. This is among the first collaborations ever that the family of Jean-Michel personally handpicked and approved. The pieces are the first of their kind to utilize never before seen artworks by Jean-Michel.\n\nThe fashion show will be closed with three Jean-Michel Basquiat collaboration looks as [Lolo Zouai](https://instagram.com/lolozouai?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) and the orchestra play a cover performance of Tu M’as Trop Ment. \n\n- **Adidas Collaboration**\n\nAdvisry and Adidas are collaborating on a shoe silhouette designed by Keith Herron that will be featured on many looks throughout the runway show. The shoes will be constructed by hand in New York City\n\n- **NOUNS Collaboration**\n\nFeatured as one of few collaborations in the fashion show alongside **Adidas** and **Basquiat,** with a trunk designed by Keith Herron alongside highlighting the physical glasses on the models. The Nouns collaboration completes the trio - highlighting fine art, heritage footwear, and the future of intellectual property.\n\n**Budget**\n\n*All production costs of the show will be split with Advisry evenly*\n\nNouns collaboration production: **$25,500**\n\n- Nouns x Advisry Soft Trunks: $1,500\n- Nouns Branding: $10,000\n- Clothing Production: $14,000\n\nVenue: **$11,500**\n\n- Rental Price: $10,000\n- Insurance: $1,500\n\nSet Design: **$10,000**\n\n- Cafe table and chair rentals: $5,000\n- Parisian style street lamps: $2,000\n- Audio: $2,000\n- Lighting: $1,000\n\nTeam: **$5,000**\n\n- Producer: $2,000\n- Stylist: $1,000\n- Show runner: $500\n- Models: $1,500\n\n**Total: ~$52,000**\n\n***33 ETH***","endBlock":"15354505","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"59","id":"129","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"3","delegatedVotesRaw":"3","id":"0x3496f3600070cc01d9665d1057f6f39afc0fe149","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1634675874","calldatas":["0x","0x","0x","0x","0x","0x","0x","0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xd77e44f294938472381a587a47f5d836c6290ea3","0x4939c898da18b0c1e71dc2a42aa545ad228711b5","0x6dfa20170603c53220cdd61ea8d7de9b7ed725ef","0x095f1fd53a56c01c76a2a56b7273995ce915d8c4","0xa77a54139b285c5294f24a492b9896c380dde01d","0x2af21e37928613582734bcbaead0919801a4cacf","0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5d635e1f0d9d9aeb85d","0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e"],"values":["1000000000000000000","750000000000000000","750000000000000000","12500000000000000","12500000000000000","20000000000000000000","23000000000000000","88000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"80","startBlock":"13463528","signatures":["","","","","","","",""],"quorumVotes":"8","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"13450388","createdTransactionHash":"0xc86c561060695a37948c4a25fb0129a2fca2eea21b652376d19850bde728f94c","description":"# Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool\n\n> *tl;dr -- Encourage creators (artists and devs) to build with Nouns by having a pool of funds held in a Safe for this purpose. The Safe will be used immediately to recognize existing a few creators in our community while also allowing fast funding of small, one-off, or alpha version projects as they appear.*\n\n\n### Past and Fast\nWhile Nouns DAO governance works well for larger projects, the multi-step, on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Despite this, many Nouns community members have added to the ecosystem and it would be great to honor their contribution.\n\nTo solve both of these issues, we'd like to propose that a pool of capital be sent to a Nouners controlled Safe. A Safe is much quicker mechanism to coordinate and distribute funds. We would like 20 ETH to pilot the pool, with a suggested range of 0.25-2 ETH per project, with the aim of:\n\n1. acknowledging, through retroactive funding, past contributions to the Nouns ecosystem\n1. granting funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n1. encouraging building and signalling that retroactive funding is a viable way to build on Nouns\n\n\n### Funding Committee\nThe initial signing committee on the Safe will be:\n- ![](https://bafkreiagjoe5qu3mcl37dwki2vp4fj4gb7kccmflsn2aaf7tzomoe7kw7a.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 12\n- ![](https://bafkreiffeqnv4rgab7e5o6vmn77ybkp3iuvcgjfu64lpu7yixiwhp7y3ty.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 16\n- ![](https://bafkreigj6v7xwubod6ustllhc5jjrhpeggzsyrmjodvqgq47zshzh2l3xi.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 22\n- ![](https://bafkreifald3ya6i62qy3s2mfefbzxnnkb25wazvqlnco3nr4xzuq6a7pae.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 32\n- ![](https://bafkreiaalajwukk3wfocjcbl6a7uufkcsepeerhvunmnyjewfhnipqn2v4.ipfs.dweb.link/) Nouns DAO\n\nThe Safe will require `2 of 4` Nouners to sign, with Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup.\n\nThe committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\n\n### Who to Retro Fund Right Now\nIn addition to the 20 ETH Safe, we proposal the immediate funding of the following creators:\n* `1 ETH` to [12BNoun](https://twitter.com/12bnoun) for developing many projects including [Nounspedia](https://twitter.com/12bnoun/status/1441940187794132994?s=20), [This-or-that](https://want2bnoun.herokuapp.com/), and [Synthetic Nouns](https://twitter.com/12bnoun/status/1445013643737776132?s=20)\n* `0.75 ETH` to [humpstyles](https://twitter.com/humpstyles) for their original, Nouns-based art [Abstract Nouns](https://opensea.io/collection/abstract-nouns)\n* `0.75 ETH` [Zeeraffe](https://twitter.com/TheZeeraffe), [JustKiddinc](https://twitter.com/justkidddinc), and [WNX](https://twitter.com/syazwanamidun) for continuing to create one [Nouns Vox](https://opensea.io/collection/voxelnouns) daily\n* `0.25` ETH to [aaaaaaaaaa](https://twitter.com/3pa15) for setting up a [Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://twitter.com/3pa15/status/1439723133586612226?s=20) for Noun Auction stats.\n\n\n\n### Transaction Details\nThis proposal will execute the following transactions:\n- `1 ETH` sent to `12BNoun` ([0xd77e44F294938472381A587a47F5D836C6290EA3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd77e44F294938472381A587a47F5D836C6290EA3))\n- `0.75 ETH` sent to `humpstyles` ([0x4939C898da18b0c1E71DC2A42aa545AD228711B5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4939C898da18b0c1E71DC2A42aa545AD228711B5))\n- `0.75 ETH` sent to the `Nouns Vox` group ([0x6Dfa20170603c53220cDD61EA8d7DE9b7Ed725Ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6Dfa20170603c53220cDD61EA8d7DE9b7Ed725Ef))\n- `0.0125 ETH` sent to `Electronic Frontier Foundation` ([0x095f1fD53A56C01c76A2a56B7273995Ce915d8C4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x095f1fD53A56C01c76A2a56B7273995Ce915d8C4)) on behalf of `aaaaaaaaaa`\n- `0.0125 ETH` sent `Save The Children` ([0xA77a54139b285C5294f24A492B9896c380dDe01D](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA77a54139b285C5294f24A492B9896c380dDe01D)) on behalf of `aaaaaaaaaa`\n- `20 ETH` sent to the `Retro Funding/Small Grants Committee's Gnosis Safe` ([0x2AF21E37928613582734bcBAeaD0919801a4CAcf](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2AF21E37928613582734bcBAeaD0919801a4CAcf))\n- `0.023` ETH sent to `Noun 32` as reimbursement for [creating the Safe](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6c27afac278642ad6512df0ec90a483e59e799e767a17d995830785bda12035d) ([0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d))\n- `0.088` ETH sent to `Noun 22` as reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal ([0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e))","endBlock":"13483238","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"20","id":"13","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"22","delegatedVotesRaw":"22","id":"0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":13}},{"createdTimestamp":"1660548154","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0xc185d966f64480bedb2ed458e7d1a1e29d95231c"],"values":["18500000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"410","startBlock":"15357830","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"41","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"2","againstVotes":"60","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15344690","createdTransactionHash":"0x79743856267bfa1fcd9baa8664ef56bdda4aa92c4f2906739c84b107a51e5c5f","description":"# Nouns Almanac Second Edition\n\n## TL;DR:\n**The Nouns Almanac Second Edition book development extends the Nouns featured in the First Edition by another 256 Nouns, showcasing a total of 512 Nouns minted in 2021/2022.**\n\n---\n\n**Project: Nouns Almanac Second Edition\nOnchain Sponsor: [@Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) (Nouncillor)\nFunding: 18.5 Ξ\nShip date: Dec 10th 2022** *(in time for Christmas shopping for kids presents)*\n\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g7nzGhV.jpg)\n\n# What Is Nouns Almanac Second Edition\n\nThe Nouns Almanac Second Edition is a physical book featuring Nouns 257 - 512, following the First Edition that featured Nouns 0 - 256.

I was introduced to Nouns by Euwyn (Noun #122 and #341), and fell enamored with the sense of community I’ve observed so far. Nounish-ness is special, and I’d love to bottle up a bit of this and spread the word about Nouns to larger audience.\n\nThis proposal is for a community-driven, studio-quality animated short film starring a Noun, with a red carpet event in Los Angeles to cap off production and bring Nouns and film community members together to inspire more collaborations.\n\nWith an origin story of falling out of their owner’s laptop - think “Finding Nemo” - the protagonist Noun will be animated in stop-motion style, composited on real footage, and film their own journey home. With the Nouns community involvement at each step, the story will be written to be captivating to a broad international audience across different languages, crypto-native and not. \n\n## Why?\n\nAllow us to introduce you to: The Noun. An animated Noun, fallen out of his owner’s laptop and finding himself lost in the real world. Starting with an animated short, audiences worldwide will watch the charming, adorable, and sneakily snarky Noun overcome obstacles, find and lose love, and much more as he films his journey home. Modernizing the mold of fictional personalities like Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, or Annoying Orange, and inspired by early Pixar shorts, we aim to make the Noun into a well-loved, viral, memeable, sharable character. \n\nA big part of our effort will be involving the community in writing a unique, compelling narrative for the noun. As a storyteller, this is where I’ll be focused. The intimacy of telling his story from his POV, with his phone camera, intercut with 3rd-person footage of his adventures, will build a lasting emotional relationship with his audience that will transfer into future projects, from this team and others. Whether it be longer YouTube videos, a TV series, or even his own feature film, people will follow the Noun wherever he goes — in the world or online.\n\nHis story will be designed to be saturated with clipable, memeable, shareable moments that don’t need context to go viral on their own. However, for the curious viewer, the clips bring them in to a larger narrative designed and produced around a genuine story and loveable protagonist.\n\n## Community-Driven Production\n\nUltimately, we want the character, and the project as a whole, to be completely emblematic of all that is Nounish. Yes, this means quirkiness, humor, personality and spontaneity, but it also means myriad factors and traits we can’t even begin to predict. This is why throughout the entire creative process we will hold bi-weekly town halls to discuss the script and invite members to share their thoughts. The character bio, the general plot, the finished screenplay, design, locations, all of it. We promise to be receptive to feedback, and additionally will host community feedback sessions to ensure our protagonist is as Nounish as can be.\n\nAlong the Noun’s journey, he will inevitably interact with other characters and Nouns in the wild, and while the Noun overcomes loneliness, fear, and anxiety, the story will lead towards an ultimate message of the value of community and collective voice. This will open an opportunity for more creatives to build and expand upon what would effectively become the Nouns Cinematic Universe. Other writers, animators, directors, with their own backgrounds, aesthetic styles, and manners of storytelling, can build upon the framework Noun sets and expand with their own real-world Noun characters and stories.\n\nWe’re not only creating a viral character who will bring attention to the Nouns project, but a platform upon which like-minded creatives can find opportunities to build art.\n\n## Development\n\n\n### Pre-Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Writing\n- Location scouting\n- Establishing workflow for animation\n- Voice actor casting\n- The casting will likely be the longest part of pre-production. In building a project based around the personality of one protagonist, the casting is crucial. We do it once, we do it right.\n\n### Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Filming\n- Recording voice lines\n- Animation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n1-2 weeks\n\n- Hiring social media marketing specialist to maximize likelihood of going viral\n- Setting up digital marketing strategy (trending hashtags, etc)\n- Deploying the videos\n\n![Budget Breakdown](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e272bac8a1a6e48b90b3caa34452bb40323cbf8e.jpeg)\n\n\nIt is our goal to create a professional, polished, award-worthy product. As such, we’re going to need a professional team. Above is our outlined 25 ETH budget, covering a worst-case scenario which can promise a perfect result. We will strive to remain under that budget, however, and any remaining surplus will go towards the following, which we hope piques your interest.\n\n## Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere \n\nAs the Noun character falls into the real world, so to do we wish to bring this to life. To cap off production, we will host a screening event in Los Angeles with a Nouns step and repeat banner, red carpet, and more, inviting members of the Nouns and film community. It’ll be an opportunity to meet the team behind the project, celebrate together, and provide another occasion for the Nouns community to gather and grow.\n\n## The Team\n\nWho are we!? We’re (mostly) recent graduates out of LA and Austin, Texas, trying to carve our way creatively. With backgrounds in literature, screenwriting, film production, animation, and design, we’re coming together to build something not only with catchy style, but with weighted substance. We don’t just want to work with Nouns to make *something* — we believe we can make something *great.*\n\n**Fedja Celebic.**\nProducer, Writer, Director\n\n[Fedja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedja-celebic-853522199/) is a USC graduate with a degree that spanned all mediums of writing and a Masters in Literary Editing and Publishing, and has found his creative satisfaction in screenwriting and producing.

A white-labeled Nouns browser app will be used for scanning the patch to claim the NFT, as well as for authenticating and verifying the garment owner and manufacturer.* \n\n*Dopamine, as the first Nouns-fork to incorporate with fashion, would like to include Nouns’ drop as one of a select few to incorporate Dopamine’s new web3 streetwear technology (”Non-Fungible Streetwear”). Nouns streetwear will be sold both at the event and online.*\n\n*Funds requested are 62-82Ξ, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.*\n\n![Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/6dxtUlx.jpg)\n\n# Introduction\n\nDopamine is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-branded collection of NFT-bundled streetwear. The collection will feature ~500 Nouns streetwear garments, each of which will be patched with a cryptographic NFC chip connecting on-chain to a Nouns-branded NFT that can be authenticated and claimed through a white-labeled Nouns browser app. The branding and experience for this drop will be Nounish end-to-end, and will fully incorporate Dopamine’s new “Non-Fungible Streetwear” technology.\n\n[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is the first Nouns-fork to incorporate fashion, with the mission to empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through a community-owned ecosystem for Non-Fungible Streetwear. We are crypto natives with a passion for streetwear culture and web3 technology, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. \n\nOriginally inspired by Nouns’ creative governance and community model, we want to become an incubator for up-and-coming streetwear designers and NFT artists and recreate the “Nouns Virtuous Cycle” for the budding web3 streetwear industry. \n\nWith this collab we’re aiming to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture using a powerful vehicle for hype: streetwear.\n\n# Designs\n\nDopamine will work closely with Apenoun to design the garments, which will feature the Noggles and the Nouns slogan “One Noun, Every day, Forever.” Around 500 pieces will be made in total, featuring a combination of t-shirts, hoodies, and various other apparel. Quality-wise, this drop will have a premium feel reminiscent of brands such as Fear of God or Acne Studios, leveraging entirely cut and sew assembly. In terms of past experience, Dopamine’s design team has worked with the likes of Billie Eilish, Young Thug’s Spider, and Siberia Hills. \n\nIn addition to the merchandise design, each garment will feature a Nouns clothing patch covering the NFC chip used to connect to its bound Nouns NFT, which itself will include a digital 3D design of the garment along with additional digital accessories (see next section). Finally, the patch itself will also be capable of triggering an AR hologram of the underlying digital design.\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/kLfrWi5.jpg)\n\n![2](https://i.imgur.com/kJYBPNF.png)\n\n![3](https://i.imgur.com/63NDcOM.jpg)\n\n![4](https://i.imgur.com/9eqWRdI.jpg)\n\n![5](https://i.imgur.com/FkUXpDq.jpg)\n\n![6](https://i.imgur.com/Axt3asS.png)\n\n![7](https://i.imgur.com/7sRU8u4.jpg)\n\nWe are continuing to iterate with Apenoun on additional designs while ensuring the entire drop remains cohesive.\n\n![8](https://i.imgur.com/31n8Mwe.png)\n\n![9](https://i.imgur.com/p8teGhg.png)\n\n# Non-Fungible Streetwear Technology\n\nDopamine is creating a decentralized fashion technology platform for authenticating and sharing a new form of chip-microchipped streetwear that we call **“Non-Fungible Streetwear”**.\n\nAt the core of each Non-Fungible Streetwear piece is a **physical-bound NFT (PNFT)**, an NFT *forever bound* to the garment through an on-chain registry that uses chip-generated ECDSA signatures for resolution, whose media represents a 3D model of the physical streetwear piece. \n\nBy scanning the garment’s patched chip with Dopamine’s white-labeled browser app, garment owners will be able to claim the PNFT, authenticate collection and manufacturer details, and view digital renditions of their streetwear in a 3D-like wardrobe. On top of this, PNFTs may be composed with arbitrary numbers of other digital assets, such as NFTs representing brand-related digital art, music, or perks. \n\nBelow, we dive into more detail on the customization process, on-chain connectivity layer, and scanning flow as it relates to Nouns’ curated Non-Fungible Streetwear collection. \n\n### Customization Process\n\n![wip10](https://i.imgur.com/gErPzVi.jpg)\n\nThe following assets will be required for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection:\n\n- **Nouns 3D PNFT Design**\nThe design file for the PNFT, which in this case will be a 3D digital rendition of the Nouns physical garment bundled as a GLTF file.\n- **Nouns Accessory Media Files**\nAdditional digital media files may be provided to build accessory NFTs. These could be anything from Nouns Art Basel POAPs to complementary Nouns digital avatars. Unlike the PNFTs which are forever bound to their garments, these accessory NFTs may be attached and detached on-chain to allow for composability with any Non-Fungible Streetwear pieces.\n- **Nouns PNFT Collection Specs**\nOwnership attribution for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear will revolve around a custom ERC721-compatible Nouns PNFT collection with a fixed supply of ~500, reflecting the total number of garments distributed. Besides the aforementioned accessorizing, additional specs may be added here, such as collection-wide metadata or whitelisting support.\n\n### On-Chain Connectivity\n\n![11](https://i.imgur.com/zs3fcSV.png)\n\nConnection between Nouns streetwear garments to Nouns PNFTs will be entirely on-chain, and will involve three major components: \n\n**NFC Chip**\n\nDopamine NFC microchips are machine-washable ~30mm round, 1mm thick chips capable of signing messages. Scanning the patched chip will enable chip-signed attestations (secured at the firmware level) to be passed through the on-chain registry to the Nouns browser app for authentication and claiming.\n\n**Chip Registry**\n\nAn ENS-like on-chain registry mapping chip ids to PNFTs will be used for connecting physical and digital worlds together in a truly decentralized manner. Included in each record will be a pre-registered IPFS cert provided by Nouns (e.g. an attestation signed by Nouns Deployer) and the chip manufacturer. \n\n**Nouns PNFTs**\n\nNouns PNFTs will act as the virtual representation and authentication interface for the Nouns’ streetwear garments. Unlike most NFTs, which are normally only owned by a user EOA, these will include two forms of ownership attribution - one involving the garment owner, and one involving the paired chip itself. \n\n### Browser App\n\nThe three above components allow the white-labeled Nouns browser app to process claims, verifications, and transfers in a way that is truly 100% decentralized. Below, we outline at a high-level how claims and normal scans work:\n\n**Claims:**\n\n![12](https://i.imgur.com/KLykF7M.png)\n\nDopamine's Non-Fungible Streetwear uses a physical-first standard for claiming. This means that recipients of the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection will first get the physical garment, and then scan the patched chip using the Nouns browser app shown above to have the ownership attribution of the PNFT assigned to them. For security reasons, only addresses of those which have purchased the collection pieces (either online or live at Art Basel) will be able to invoke the initial claim.\n\n**Scans:**\n\n![13](https://i.imgur.com/uWHAKW2.png)\n\nAnyone with an NFC-enabled smart device will be able to tap their devices on the Nouns’ chip patches to view details regarding garment owner and authenticity through the Nouns browser app. In addition, these scans will showcase the PNFT media assets in an interactive 3D wardrobe-like environment, along with any bundled accessories.\n\n## Dopamineland @ **Art Basel Miami**\n\nThe Nouns x Dopamine drop will feature at our Art Basel Miami multi-day event “Dopamineland” as part of a select group of 5 partners representing the best and the brightest of web3 culture and meme power. \n\nThe Nouns area will be a fully Nouns-branded immersive experience featuring on-site “activations” giving users direct interaction with the Nouns bundles and their physical-digital features.\n\nNouns Non-Fungible Streetwear will be available for purchase on-site and online via credit card or ETH. For online orders, shipments will be handled through Shopify.\n\n## Nouns x Dopamine Bundle Cost Breakdown\n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~82Ξ \n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~62Ξ  - 82Ξ \n\n- Curation Fee (incl.

It’s a wild, novel genre that’s inspiring a new generation of creators, artists, and storytellers. \n\n### Click image to watch Blu present the proposal\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ktZaS52qyYA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktZaS52qyYA) \n\nWe’re a team of two with a shared passion for bringing avatars and worlds to life. We want to help bring Nouns into the 3D metaverse with our unique storytelling and world-building skills. We propose a XANADU x NOUNS collaboration consisting of two parts:\n\n### Part One - Nouns Episode of Xanadu \nWe would create a mega-episode of Xanadu where Blu, the hero of Xanadu, teams up with Nouns in an action-packed deep dive into the Nouns Universe.\n\nThe episode features Blu questing through Planet Nouns desperate for the Nouns help to save him from a posse of intergalactic gangsters. To satisfy the bounty on his head, Blu must submit a winning proposal to Nouns DAO which kicks off a wild escapade through the Nouns City Center, the historic Nouner Capitol building, and the Nouns Underground. Along the way, Blu meets a master Noun who gives him a crash course on NounsDAO, how it works and why it’s awesome — education disguised as Hollywood quality entertainment. But it doesn’t stop there…\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e4951cf151fd7bfb2f983a7dbcb7ed901ce5614d.gif)\n\n### Part Two - CC0 Nouns Toolkit\nUnlike a Hollywood feature where all the creativity and work vanish after the movie’s made, all of the Nouns assets created for this episode will be crafted into a Nouns World Toolkit that will live on in an innovative and powerful new way — in the hands of the community, available CC0.\nThis is more than a simple library of assets…\n\nBecause Xanadu is built in a game engine (Unreal Engine 5), it’s a story world that can be cinematic, interactive, gamified, live-streamed, or experienced in VR. So, armed with this massive toolkit of AAA animatable Nouns characters & pre-lit, animated environments — complete with how-to guide books & tutorials created by us — the Nouns community can inhabit a Noun for VTubing, Zoom calls, or create cinematic content, marketing materials, NFTs, or even build a Nouns VR experience, game, or metaverse. It’s our hope for this to become the beginning of a dynamic Nouns repository that grows over time and is contributed to by other builders. (Full list of Toolkit deliverables below in Extra Details)\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/1/137fa14e33c6b60152c5c4700e5f77bb82b719f1.gif)\n\n### How does this benefit NounsDAO?\n- **The Episode** — Exposure for NounsDAO in a novel, powerful narrative – with analytics & insights (average results per episode: 2.7M impressions, 321K views, 12K watch-time hours)\n- **The Toolkit** — 3D tools that enables Nouns creators, creations, remixes with other IPs, and continued proliferation of Nouns to a new degree.\n- **Our Vision** — Inspire creators with the episode, enable creations with the toolkit, and catalyze a cohort of Nouns as VTubers and next-generation virtual avatars.\n\n### Community \nWorking directly with the Nouns community is key for this project in several ways:\n1. **Help choose what Nouns derivatives to feature** such as LilNouns, SharkDAO, skateboards from GnarsDAO, and art pieces from prop house. We love the extended Nouns community want to infuse this thriving ecosystem into the Toolkit and Episode.\n2. **Help define the 3D style of the Nouns characters and environments**, as well as how Nouns express themselves using motion capture and animation.\n3. **Help choose Nouns characters to be featured in the episode.** Some Nouns will be chosen for story purposes but we’d love the community to vote on what other Nouns get featured. Those Nouns holders will have the option to voice & motion capture their own Noun (assuming there’s dialogue).\n\n### The General Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Concept & Design + Episode Writing.** starts immediately (est 2 months)\n* Phase 2: **Asset creation.** Starts as concepts complete (est 2-3 months) Will overlap with Phase 1\n* Phase 3: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Assets are made available as they are created.\n* Phase 4: **Episode Production Starts** Jan 2023 *When assets are finished (est 3 months)\nEst Episode completion March 2023\n\n### Toolkit Repository Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Post assets as they become available\n* Phase 2: **Create Beta How to Docs & Tutorials.** (these will roll out starting in Dec thru March)\n* Phase 3: **Launch final Toolkit Repository.** March 2023\nWe will be sharing fun BTS & asset creation along the way via YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram content.\n\n### Our Ask & Budget Breakdown \nWe are asking for a total of $307.2K USD (192E @ $1600)\n* Toolkit Concept Art & Design — $20,480 (12.8ETH)\n* Toolkit 3D Modeling & Texturing — $99,040 (61.9ETH)\n* Nouns Character Modeling & Rigging — $33,440 (20.9ETH)\n* Toolkit Assembly & Episode Production — $141,280 (88.3ETH)\n* Toolkit publishing & maintenance — $12,960 (8.1ETH)\n\nThe proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be converted to USDC immediately, and everything in excess will be retrurned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, there is insufficient ETH to cover the proposed budget (307.2K USD), a second proposal will be made.\n* Total: 192ETH * 1.15 = 220.8ETH\n\n---\n\n## Extra Details\n\n### The Nouns World Toolkit Repository \nThe CCO repository will consist of the cast of Nouns characters and environments made for the episode. Everything will be set up in the Unreal Engine (Free game engine software) and we're going to include all the scenes, cameras, lighting and animation from the episode which means, the Nouns City center will be alive with ambient animation and amazing cinematic lighting.  Additionally, the scenes from the episode will provide a starting point for making new content that looks amazing. All the Nouns characters will be rigged and ready for motion capture style animation (Both face and body similar to how Blu is setup in Xanadu).  For those with the right gear, this means you can instantly puppet any of those Nouns for V-Tubbing or creating your own cinematic content.  We're also exploring 'off the shelf' webcam mocap solutions (Cheap or free but body motion quality not as good as the expensive mocap suites) to include, if possible, to make inhabiting the nouns characters more accessible.  This would also allow using Nouns for Zoom calls, etc. \n\n### Nouns World Toolkit Details\n* 12 Hero Nouns (Face & Body fully rigged for motion capture)\n* 24 Secondary Nouns (Body fully rigged for motion capture. Minimal to no facial animation)\n* Beautifully lit and fully animated environments:\n* Nouns Downtown City Center (exterior, like Time Square)\n        * Buildings reflecting the Nouns extended family\n* Nouner Capitol Building (Exterior & Interior) \n* Nouns underground city / town (Exterior)\n* Noun masters Dojo (Exterior & Interior)\n* General modular city assets *for building new structures\n* General nounish props & furniture \n* Nouns transport vehicles\n* Wide Establishing model of the Nouns Planet\n* Guide Book & Tutorials on using the Toolkit to create Vtuber & Cinematic content \n\n### Technical Details\n* Unreal Engine 5 project - CC0\n* Assets performant in Real-time (Streaming)\n* Assets performant in VR\n* Fully animated Hero scenes from episode included as examples\n        * All hero Nouns characters ready for motion capture (Face and Body)\n\n### Production Team\n* Art Direction, Episode Writing & Directing\n* Producer\n* Lighting\n* Motion Capture\n* Animation\n* Cinematography\n* UE4 Integration & Tooling\n* VFX\n* Actors\n* Editing\n* Music\n* Sound Design\n\n### Episode Details\n* 20-30 minutes\n\n### About Xanadu & beyond\nThe heart of Xanadu is its zany stories and wild characters, but its soul burns to bridge and play in other universes. Thus Blu wants to help bring to life the budding spectrum of web3 Pop-Cultures from Nouns, cloneX and BAYC to small burgeoning Avatar projects backed by talented teams or individuals. All so they can collide on a bigger, more wild stage, with bigger, more wild crossover stories! Think Ready Player One and the Marvel Universe but creator content style!\n\n### FUN BONUS IDEA: Wild Story Twist!\nBlu’s adventure with the Nouns will live on beyond this episode in a ‘first-of-its-kind’ melding of entertainment & reality; After this episode airs, Blu’s fictional proposal (The one he formulates in the episode with help from the Nouns) is actually a real proposal that he submits to the Nouns DAO… and the outcome of that proposal dictates Blu’s future storyline – Will his proposal be good enough for approval, or will Blu have to evade the gangsters and find another solution to survive?\n\nIf you haven’t seen Xanadu yet, check it out [Xanadu on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/xanaduBlu) and our original proposal teaser.\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xJTpIGK3tUc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xJTpIGK3tUc) \n\nThank you,\nCory & Stephen","endBlock":"15483988","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"140","id":"135","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"1","delegatedVotesRaw":"1","id":"0x1a4370fdd7173d0a41ff7c63a8e0249479ba0225","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1662068728","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0xb293c23ed9a0241da1de4aab649246652346bdd6"],"values":["40000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"429","startBlock":"15468434","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"42","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"97","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15455294","createdTransactionHash":"0xe9ae9f606e20aab6b0126972fe3e4f77f66019f460642c4095202f204a3c4e7c","description":"# Founding Partners of NFT Seattle\n\n(*TLDR, NFT Seattle is the first large scale Web3 event in the entire Pacific Northwest. We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event*)\n\n### **DESCRIPTION**\n\n- Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.\n- As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we'd love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle's technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT's.\n\n### **WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE**\n\n- NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).\n- The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation & connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate & expose them to the opportunities & possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.\n- This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.\n- NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).\n\n### **WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED & WHY IT MATTERS?**\n\n- NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.\n- As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.\n- This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing *Nouns on the Ground* an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).\n\n### **THE BREAKDOWN**\n\n- **Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle** (”NFT Seattle presented by the Nouns”). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.\n    \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/jDWDkc8.png)\n\n\n    \n- **Live Art Premier** that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist [Jaiden ‘Jasti’ Stipp](https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/), the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT's.\n- As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We’ll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.\n- **Evergreen Video Content** to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.\n- **Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack** provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we'd need help designing the stickers).\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/poa1pxT.jpg)\n\n\n    \n- **Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails** that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. We just recently kicked off a regional PR campaign, the Nouns imagery will be added to the the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.\n\n- **Fireside chat with a Noun**, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT's, using Nouns as a use-case.\n\n\n### **THE ASK**\n\nThis is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:\n\n- $65,000 USD ~ 40 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,600)\n    - 10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)\n    - 16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses\n    - 10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)\n    - 4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by Jasti (reusable at future events)\n    \n    ***N.B.** This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.*\n    \n\n### **WHY SEATTLE**\n\n- Seattle is an emerging market in Web3 with events just starting to take place. (ETHSeattle, blockchain events, and now NFT Seattle)\n- Starbucks is entering Web3 and launching an NFT collection ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/starbucks-teases-web-3-platform-in-nft-announcement/)) and it’s in good company among other major brands with a substantial presence in Washington who are either ALL-IN or dabbling in Web3- Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple.\n- Besides SF, Seattle has more tech talent than any other city in the country ([425 Business](https://www.425business.com/news/greater-seattle-no-2-in-tech-talent-report/article_37815015-8e5d-58f2-81fa-593715c7f695.html)) and it’s also the country’s most desired location for people aged 18 to 24 ([Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living/seattle-wa/)), making the city an ideal place for Web3 brands to establish a presence in order to attract and retain top talent.\n- 75% or more of PNW Angel Investors are interested in Web3 companies and founders. ([Madrona Venture Group](https://www.madrona.com/angel-investors-pacific-northwest-directory/))\n- Seattle is the US’ primary gateway to Asia, the best city in America for outdoor activities, the 13th best city to live in overall, and the eighth-best city for raising a family.

We seek to impact various causes by addressing problems that affect our society. Mucho Love aims to cultivate a community in which all members feel part of something bigger than themselves, making them feel nounish.\n\n### How does Mucho Love work?\n\nMucho Love was created by 5 founders, who wear many hats and structured what it is today. We plan to expand the team next year to escalate further and establish more specific scopes. Currently, we have over 30 community members eager to volunteer for the causes we are aiding.\n\nMucho Love currently works on a 9-step system.\n\n1. **Ideation:** planning and deciding on activities.\n2. **Outreach:** contacting the organizations/places, writing letters/petitions, and setting up dates/places.\n3. **Chronogram/Requirements:** Itinerary, step-by-step program to be performed on events, pre-event checklist, proofreading.\n4. **Quotations:** quotation of each item or service (3 quotations from different companies per item or service)\n5. **Payments and Negotiations:** negotiating with businesses, establishing formal relationships, explaining MUCHO LOVE, and paying for services/items.\n6. **Pre-Event:** revision of the pre-event checklist, volunteer count, and Zoom meetings with volunteers and multimedia team to prepare for the event.\n7. **Event Day:** role call, transportation to the event, itinerary execution, feedback.\n8. **Post Event:** post-event multimedia management and feedback from participants.\n9. **Documentation:** establishing the framework to replicate the current working system by documenting for the continuous improvement of the project.\n\n### How does this benefit the DAO?\n\n**Charity** is a recurrent activity/topic within the Nounish ecosystem—that’s why we decided to start a nounish volunteering community that makes sure to proliferate Nouns with the values and vision it represents. **Mucho Love aims to become one of the Nounish platforms regarding community service, social work, and volunteering campaigns.** Mucho Love’s activities will all be shared through Twitter and Instagram, appealing to the masses and expanding global Noggle adoption.\n\nMucho Love is starting operations in the Dominican Republic but aims to develop a model that is replicable internationally. Also, if needed, we want to be able to travel to any part of the world to aid any team who needs help developing charitable efforts in their respective communities. \n\n### Goals\n\nOur goal is to **establish the foundation of Mucho Love as a future Decentralized Non-Profit Organization** **that will allow us to replicate the model in any part of the world.** The structure/model created will be available for any team that wants to make charitable efforts in their respective communities. We also want to keep collaborating with established Nounish projects (like BigShotKlim’s pins and Messhup’s books) that can contribute with donations to proliferate Nouns further.\n\nMucho Love will carry out during the 4-month extension events/donations/activities among the following:\n\n* Hospital Robert Ried\n* Hospital Hugo Mendoza\n* Red Misericordia (Orphanage)\n* Hogar Escuela Santo Domingo Savio (Orphanage/School)\n* Escuelita Café con Leche (Orphanage/School)\n\n*2 institutions have not given a definitive yes; therefore, they are subject to change.\n\n### Pilot results\n\nThe pilot successfully helped children feel joy despite going through difficult moments. We also showed what the Noggles are and what they can do. People fell in love with Messhup’s books and BigShotKlim’s Noggle pins. Children that used glasses felt even more identified with the Noggles. I can genuinely say that the pilot was a success; the Noggles were well received, and we helped out 300 children and their parents while proliferating Nouns, love, and optimism.\n\n300 Children received 300 Nounish goodie bags containing:\n\n* Messhup’s coloring book (300 total)\n* Crayola box (300 total)\n* Diapers (1440 total)\n* Stickers (600 total)\n* BigShotKlim’s Noggle Pins (100 total)\n\nVideo recap:\n\n\n#### [MUCHO LOVE ](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\n[@mucholovedr](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\nSpreading ❤️ with ⌐◧-◧ *⌐◧-◧ are used to protect children’s identity https://t.co/PWvO4nhZYA\n\n### Budget\n\n24 ETH to be distributed in the following way:\n\n* 19 ETH for donations\n* 3 ETH for photo/video crew\n* 1 ETH for t-shirts and hats for volunteers to use during the events\n* 1 ETH for a storage facility\n\n*The team has not received any compensation, nor is it interested in getting compensation until we go on-chain again by the end of the year.\n\n*If any Nounish Project creator wants to collaborate with their products/ideas feel free to reach out to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FGPF9af.jpg)\n\n","endBlock":"15518506","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"154","id":"137","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"22","delegatedVotesRaw":"22","id":"0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":13}},{"createdTimestamp":"1662573921","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x96c80ab80a920efd32485bc2fb9dfec601f357e6"],"values":["20000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"436","startBlock":"15504931","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"43","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"65","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15491791","createdTransactionHash":"0xf49ddb019aa5e7294ef414b6aa3c05fd721be4e5f168ddb3fa2501a0a028b31d","description":"# Nouns X Internet Game: Season 2 w/ gmoney\n\n**Dear NounsDAO,**\n\nI’m a *huge* fans of Nouns. A big part of my Solidity education was forking the Nouns contract back when we were at Noun #3. So I’m super thrilled to present an idea that integrates Nouns into what I've been working on for 2 years, & can contribute to the Nounish goal of spreading the Nouns meme far & wide.\n\n----\n\n**TLDR:** We are Internet Game. We host massive web3 game shows with thousands of players and blue-chip NFT prizes. Our Season 2 is coming up next, hosted by gmoney, and we’d like to re-skin one of the games to feature Nouns, as well as educate our players about Nouns with a video prior to the game.\n\nBefore we get into specifics, we’ll share a bit more about who we are and why we’re qualified to propose this…\n\n## What is Internet Game??\n\n[Internet Game](https://internet.game/) is Squid Game meets NFTs. We create live, interactive game shows that anyone can play at home with hyper-simple, yet dangerously fun mini-games. 60% of buy-ins go to blue-chip NFT prizes, all voted on by the community in Discord.\n\nIn March 2022 we launched our Internet Game: [Season 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.g13ad4d9e874_0_0). 8000 players minted $2.2M in NFTs to play. We then purchased $1M+ in NFT prizes as voted on by the players, including Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Doodles, Azukis, CloneX and many more.\n\nThe best way to fully understand how our seasons work is to[ look at this case study](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.p).\n\nInternet Game: Season 2 “Bear Market Battle” launches on September 12th. Season 2 features 6 brand new games taking place between September 12th and 23rd. The entire event is hosted by the infamous gmoney & comedian Leah Lamarr. Gmoney will appear as a full 3D version of his cryptopunk by being rigged up in a high-fidelity motion capture suit, and will then be superimposed on an XR stage (picture a gigantic LED screen & floor) next to Leah.\n\n## Season 2 Trailer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lr3GruECkk\n\nHere’s a preview of what that looks like from the podcast we did with gmoney on the XR stage with him in the co-cap suit:\n\n![|624x323](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R2_yJv7VgaZlSyENj-pB3qwG82IdRuM9S1i94XuvPAeTjmR2gD5Hnqiz-vE7NWVMMAFtEY4ZTSFat4h1jg9DTlxnubOXHtnfWIhRnJIAmcmypoVrmrmuGvGc5RIU2Hw-z3xxbllb31NhvAAY-eXIk8w)\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks. Each game runs for 24 hours.\n\nThere is an opportunity to fully brand the third game, currently titled as “The Last Spaceship”, and transform it into “The Last Noun”.\n\nThe game itself is similar to an old school Asteroids / Galaga space shooter, but with an original take on how you move around the space. We think the 2D arcade aesthetic is a perfect match for the Nouns art. Both the main character as well as the enemies would be Nouns:\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks.

If desired, we could include a trailer / explainer / hype video for Nouns in that video. This would need to be provided by Nouns DAO.\n\n**Additional opportunities during Season 2:**\n\n* Including Nouns and/or Lil Nouns in our prize pool\n* Skinning the entire Internet Game tournament page during “The Last Noun” game to be Nouns-branded\n* Upon the launch of the game, post a write up on our social platforms (Twitter/Discord) to educate our audience on Nouns DAO and the Nouns mission & mechanics\n\n## Our Ask:\n\n**ETH Sponsorship:** Nouns DAO would contribute 20 ETH to Internet Game Season 2. The sponsorship would be split to further contribute to the prize pool and cover operational expenditures incurred by Internet Game.\n\n## Proposed Timeline & Next Steps\n\n* Engage in discussions to answer any questions derived from this proposal\n* Gain approval to transform “The Last Spaceship” into “The Last Noun”\n* Announce partnership with Nouns DAO for Season 2 including the donation to the prize pool\n* Complete redesign of the tournament page and game and showcase to Nouns DAO for feedback\n* Launch “The Last Noun” Game on September 16th, along with the optional pre-game video\n\n## Long-Term Opportunity: Nouns Custom Casual Game\n\nWe we would love to continue the relationship and build a fully custom game for Nouns that can live on in perpetuity. The game would be co-created by the DAO and Internet Game to provide a unique experience that allows consumers to connect with the Nouns brand in an interactive way. Casual gaming is a juggernaut of an industry due to its accessibility (ease of learning), low effort requirement, and repeat value (easy to hop in and out of) it provides. We see a Nouns Game as a way to engage the general population in a highly scalable and interactive way all around the world. Details on this longer-term partnership opportunity can be submitted through a separate proposal.\n\n---\n\n*Thank you for reading! We'll be excitedly watching the voting.*","endBlock":"15524641","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"87","id":"138","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x96c80ab80a920efd32485bc2fb9dfec601f357e6","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1662598112","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xe8cf782bb4acb9000fae76ba940295ca988de7be"],"values":["72000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"436","startBlock":"15506668","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"43","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15493528","createdTransactionHash":"0x026ca1107cddf565d3e00c3adc3e85bfca764fd8a5cc9a9be368f94f5aaa2dd7","description":"# Noun Sounds Proposal\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/AqMhNe3.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/746662212\n)\n\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/746662212\n\n## **TL;DR** \n\nNoun Sounds will provide a much needed audio-scape to the Nouns ecosystem.  SuperTightWoody and Papaya will create a platform and ingest processes where anyone can create, export and contribute CC0 Nounish songs, stems, samples, sounds effects and more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/96a5gtJ.png)\n\n# The Problem\n\nThere is currently no Nouns audio aesthetic, and no environment for it to flourish. There are no sonic logos, sounds or songs that have a consistent use case in the Nouns world. Nounish creators of apps, videos, games and beyond have nowhere to turn for audio. \n\nNounish creators have to source their own audio, often out of their own pocket while being forced to manage limited use rights.\n\nAll of this makes brand consistency/recognition difficult and next to impossible. Sonic logos, sounds or songs are a core part of any brand.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VN0FNJY.png)\n\n\n# Our Solution\n\n**nounsounds.wtf**\n\nWe will create a robust website that will act as a hub for all things related to Nouns audio. This will include an easy to use music “PLAYground” to build a unique Nouns song for your project, a repository of samples/sounds/songs and a robust roadmap with processes and structure, allowing our environment to grow.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UevPiIZ.png)\n\n---\n\n# The User Experience\n\n## **Homepage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z53wdaT.png)\n\nOn the homepage, the latest Noun Sound will be displayed along with the Noun it generates!  **This, and all Noun Sounds, will be available for free use and CC0**.\n\n How does it generate this Noun Sound you might ask?  Let’s head over to the…\n\n## **PLAYground**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pwDMdY5.png)\n\nThe visual Noun will be generated via the PLAYground tab.  \n\nIn this area, a song is split into its different tracks. Here, one of the 10 songs created for Nouns will be selected.  Each song will contain 5 variations per instrument. Each instrument will correspond to a Nouns layer whose assets will be randomly generated when the page loads. \n\nRefreshing the page or hitting the “Randomize” button will randomly select a new SONG and new set of LAYERS.  Every time you create a new Nouns Sound, a unique new Noun will be born to accompany it!\n\nPut together your favorite song tracks for your project and…VOILA!  You now have your own unique Noun Sound.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/kAFMtLi.png)\n](https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87)\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87\n\n## **Sounds**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9DU37V1.png)\n\nIf you want to grab any of the full songs, stems, loops, samples or sound effects by themselves- this is the place to go.  Easily filter these via metadata and get to creating your Nounish multimedia! \n\n# How Does This Proliferate Nouns?\n\n***Sound*** is the backbone of any cohesive brand and multimedia creation.  This CC0 resource will assist in the production of music, apps, games, videos, social content, sonic branding and more- all revolving around Nouns.  As we work along side Nouns DAO in the future, a self sustaining library of high quality audio will fill a void for creators across all mediums of creative content. \n\n# The Team\n\nWith 20+ years of music production and engineering experience, **SuperTightWoody** is a Grammy Nominated music producer.  Having works featured on major label albums, TV shows, movie trailers and television commercials.  In the Nouns space, he has created the theme song for the Nouncil along with theme songs for The Noun Square Twitter spaces (and the “soundboard” for TNS).  As a Nouncil and TNS member- he is very much looking forward to expanding his contributions into the Nouns space.\n\n**Papaya** is a software engineer with 15+ years of experience known for his attention to detail. He has worked on numerous NFT Collections, tools and Defi protocols. He loves building unique experiences for web3 communities and developers. \n\n# Timeline\n\nThe creation of everything laid out in this first proposal will take 3 months to complete from proposal approval.\n\n# Proposed Funding\n\n72ETH for deliverables + timeline. \n*Signers will be SuperTightWoody and Papaya for multisig wallet 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be*\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\n**This Proposal: First Audio Library + Infrastructure**  \n\nOur first proposal is to create the first Nounish audio library, a website, an easy-to-use tool for builders to create songs, and laying out the workflows for onboarding new music makers into the system processes.\n\n- *A fully functional Noun Sounds website with user friendly audio interfaces*\n- *10 CC0 Noun Sounds songs (+ 5 variations of each instrument for the PLAYground)*\n- *3 Nouns sonic logo stings*\n- *20 bleeps, bloops, swooshes and more for apps and games*\n- *All songs, stems and individual samples page available for download*\n- *Twitter account and Discord for building the Noun Sounds community*\n\n---\n\n**Next Proposal: New Tools + Bring on other musicians**\n\nOnce this infrastructure has been built and our ingestion flow for new audio is set, it’s time to grow independently.\n\n- *Create Noun Sounds DAO*\n- *Start developing system to Fund DAO through the sales of generated Noun Sounds NFTs.*\n- *Create pipeline for onboarding new musicians via sounds submissions + legal processes*\n- *Create professional VST instruments that music makers can use in the DAW of their choice, to create an audio palette that allows total freedom while keeping brand cohesion*\n- *Explore the use of AI and other technologies to push the envelope of what is possible*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/etJbiGT.png)\n\n## Additional Links:\n\nwww.supertight.co\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/supertightwoody\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/nounspoap\n\n## Proposed Transactions:\n\n1. 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be.transfer(\n 72 ETH\n)\n","endBlock":"15526378","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"110","id":"139","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"12","delegatedVotesRaw":"12","id":"0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":9}},{"createdTimestamp":"1635341257","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xa83d0b93c1044f0fb698dd8221fcfafad3753d0b"],"values":["11890000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"88","startBlock":"13512803","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"8","proposalThreshold":"0","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"13499663","createdTransactionHash":"0xa7925d4ee4f6f01183815243cdb93ad14ff5d6522bbf644a25165fb189a70b2a","description":"# Brave Sponsored Takeover during NFT NYC\n\n### Proposal\n\nBrave proposes a partnership between Nouns DAO and the browser’s native ad unit: Sponsored Images, to come together and use the 24 hour takeovers as a space to showcase the Nouns project on the first day of NFT NYC (November 1st, 2021)\n\n### Details\n\nRegion: USA\nFlight Dates: 11/1/2021\nEstimated Impressions: 11,000,000\nNouns DAO Rate: 11.89 ETH\n\n- Nouns DAO representative (4156) will Docusign agreement and Nouns DAO will execute payment when this proposal passes\n- Community members will provide artwork for 3 sponsored images in collaboration with Brave Ads team (see #brave-takeover in Nouns Discord) and will be compensated via the retroactive funding group\n- Images will appear in rotation for 24h from November 1 at 00:00 AM EST until November 1 at 11:59 PM EST","endBlock":"13532513","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"25","id":"14","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xf476cd75be8fdd197ae0b466a2ec2ae44da41897","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":-1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1663013789","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x58a25b8c593c75f6bceb2c805a53437da3c53757"],"values":["40000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"442","startBlock":"15535972","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"44","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15522832","createdTransactionHash":"0x314ce8abcac3147b44e7f1d4fd5238cb15310ae502409207b03fb6fe09172844","description":"# Pilot: Crowdsourced Prop House\n\n### tl;dr:\n\nRequesting 40 ETH to pilot using Prop House as a self-curation tool.\n\n### Preliminary Round:\n\nThe preliminary round will be used to source ideas for prop house topics from the community.

We have communicated updates weekly on the [Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/973957832015761428) and have had many conversations on [Discourse here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nounish-friends-nouns-town-collectible-figures-and-more-by-bigshottoyworks/967/42?page=3&fbclid=IwAR2b6AnS2-xKAbn0eja5dL0k1LCufZM4v_nT5NbJXzZ_ZWWb5FEo_PIxly8), gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs we’re proposing today. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJ5emSS.jpg)\n\n___\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n___\n**CURRENT STAGE:**\n - **Engineering:**  tooling masters, paint masks, production molds, Packaging, Final branding, box and display box design and dies: $45K ***(one time cost)***\n - **Manufacturing:** $53K for 10K pcs \n - **Logistics/warehousing:** $29K\n - **Marketing, project management & B2B & B2C sales:** $40K for 6 months. This involves sample photography,press, targeted social media engagement, onboarding  and follow ups, potential partner onboarding and communications. This includes unexpected sample creations and air shipping for events such as Art Basel, Dcon, NFTNYC and other opportunities world wide while the mass production run is being produced.\n - **TOTAL ASK:** $167K USD\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:**\nPayments to be broken down into 3 milestones as follows: \n - **35% upfront** ($58,450 USD)\nPreproduction deposit for further final development of graphics, packaging templates, tooling molds, paint molds, and final samples.\n - **35% on Milestone 1** ($58,450 USD)\nDeposit for mass production deposit once tooling test shots and painted counter sample approvals,\n - **30% on Milestone 2** (50,100 USD)\nFull balance paid out once production passes testing. QC inspection and is ready to ship to our warehouse by sea.\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n - **GNOSIS SAFE**\nETH will be sent to a 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim - 0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C\nJoshua Fisher - JoshuaFisher.eth\nJoel Cares - JoelCares.eth\n\n - **ETH -> USD CONVERSION**\nCalculations done on 9/14/2022 at $1,600 USD / ETH\nProject Cost = $167,000 USD = 104.38 ETH\nVolatility Buffer (10%) = 10.44 ETH\nTOTAL ASK = 114.82 ETH \n\n - **PROCEDURE**\n   - A 10% buffer was added to the ask to account for volatility in ETH prices prior to conversion.\n   - Upon recieving the funds Gnosis Safe operators will immediately convert ETH to USDC to cover total Project Cost. The USDC will be held in the safe and released to Bigshot Klim when Milestones are completed.\n   - If for any reason there are excess funds (ETH remaining  after conversion, milestones not hit) any unspent funds will be returned to Nouns DAO.\n   - If the value of ETH falls sufficiently before conversion and this value no longer covers project costs another proposal will be submitted to cover the difference. \n\n - **TRANSACTION**\ntransfer 114.82 ETH to 0xA04D191Ae755c442B5e4a0ea10136b7B0354cC6a\n\n___\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n___\n\nOur 10,000 physical toys will be utilized for both sales and giveaways for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof of concept model moving forward:\n\n - 10% -1,000 toys(100 sets) allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like Nouns OTG, Rose Bowl and Art Basel Miami etc. Final production Toys will be allocated and shipped from our warehouse (worldwide approx shipping/handling cost $35 per case of toys) \n - 9,000 units to be sold at SRP $14/toy, or approx $7 wholesale + shipping. Portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and put forth in a proposal if the project is a success. \n - Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $7/unit \n - Option to re-order at lower unit cost ($5-6/unit) in a future run.\n - Option to create unique colorways & revised single-unit packaging at lower unit cost.\n - A collectible card with a POAP is included with each toy. Use TBD, but it will help with future engagement and retain customer attention.Collectors and fans could receive digital goodies, participate in games, contests or win prizes from our NOUNWORKS shop, and/or have access to unique experiences for POAP holders only. Goodies and prizes can be things in our shops or future items from the community based on the promotions and future partnerships and collaborations(TBD) based on Nounish partners and collaborations.\n\nIt is imperative that we expedite manufacturing so that we can have product ready for public introduction and review at Designercon in November 18-20 2022 (10X20 Booth booked), Art Basel in Miami in December, and possible availability for distribution at Rose Bowl (Jan 1, 2023) with Stoopid Buddy Studios. We can support global meet ups with products as well as some blank figures for local artists to paint.\n\n\n\nAll of the items ship from a central location in USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned. These steps, including ongoing press and social media support, are crucial to any project of this scope and everything has a price. Since we have multiple ongoing projects with NOUNs and plan many more, we want to be as efficient as possible with our time as well as resources.\nWe are excited to create and distribute the very best  Nouns toys! We have built out a model that is scalable for large-scale runs in the future after this concept is proven.\n","endBlock":"15568845","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"78","id":"141","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"12","delegatedVotesRaw":"12","id":"0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":9}},{"createdTimestamp":"1663455467","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xce2d9c8d3a7802ce0bda1e1003332ff132bba3d2"],"values":["12500000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"447","startBlock":"15569557","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"44","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"29","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15556417","createdTransactionHash":"0x643897a67d3e959b59ca8b9e93362ab6889ed2ec7d90ec22177dd27701fef8fc","description":"\"# Nounifying Brazil and Web3 Workshops in communities of Rio de Janeiro\n\n*This proposal submission was executed by [Gnars DAO](https://gnars.com).*\n\nNounify the skate lane in the Gigoia Island community and onboard 120 teenagers – from 11 to 14 years old – to web3 at the *[Skate Cuida Institute](https://www.instagram.com/skatecuida/?hl=pt)* - both in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n**Why?**\n\nAccording to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/), **Brazil is the 2nd country with the most people using NFTs (5M users).**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d7fhQsI.png)\n\nRio de Janeiro stands out as a crypto hub. In June, the 1st international NFT event in Brazil took place in the city. Gathering renowned Brazilian artists, collections of different styles and lectures about web3, NFTs and DAOs, NFT Rio showed the potential of the Brazilian market.\n\nThe Nouns DAO featured as one of the main collections during the event. [After the approval of proposal 98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98), [@beautyandpunk](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk), [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) and [@fabioseva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva) did a great job spreading the noun culture at the conference. We want to further develop this work.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mohS5HA.png)\n\nFor this, the plan is to:\n## 1) Promote 4 educational workshops about web3 in Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x4A8LV0.png)\n*Bob Burnquist with the teenagers from the Skate Cuida Institute*\n\nThe workshops are divided in 4 stages:\n**a) Wallets and tokens:** first, a “magic trick” makes money disappear… and reappear inside the pocket of an attendee. The instructor explains what are “the secret crypto words”, how they can “control magic internet money”, and how anyone - even kids - can earn, use or store such money.\n\n**b) NFTs:** the instructor shows attendees how digital wallets can hold other digital stuff. A series of these valuable things have been scattered through the Skate Cuida Institute (QR codes linking to a minting page). A treasure hunt leads attendees to earn their first NFTs.\n\n**c) DAO:** the instructor shows a site where they can use their NFTs as tickets to join a club. He tells them there is a proposal there where they can vote for a prize that will be distributed either to half the “club”… or to all of its members - depending on how they vote it. The instructor reveals the results (awarding a prize in crypto to every participant) and teaches basic concepts in cooperation and game theory. He tells the audience the workshop was sponsored by a “club”, too - NounsDAO - that collaborates online to do cool stuff in the real world. And incites attendees they can do the same via the club they now belong to.\n\n**d) Skate & Lunch:** to wrap things up, Bob Burnquist invites the kids for a ride on the Institute’s track, then **food and drinks** are served for all.\n\nWe plan to bring 30 kids in each workshop. The goal is to **introduce 120 people to crypto and NFTs** via Nouns DAO.\n\nThe end goal is to find a format ([presentation here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHzoOmwAE/OhifeRzHPUSLD7X1YLORVQ/view?utm_content=DAFHzoOmwAE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishpresent)) that can be replicated in other communities in a cost-effective way.\n\n**The workshops will be conducted by guiriba, a member of Paradigma Education**.

Most of the amazing projects that Nouns funds need help telling their story, and video is the best way to do so.\n\nIt is safe to assume that without the videos we published, Nouns DAO would have missed the opportunity of amplifying the stories of these wonderful projects. \n\nWith video, we are able to tell a much deeper and colorful story and evoke much more emotion. We believe this must be 10Xed to recruit more builders to help the meme proliferate. \n\n## The Nouns Funnel\n\nWe think of builder & community onboarding as a funnel: \n\n\n\n* **Top of Funnel**: People who heear about Nouns from a friend, stumble upon a Nouns project in their city, enjoy a piece of nouns art on twitter etc. \n* **Middle of Funnel**: People who become curious to understand what Nouns are, want to learn how to get funded, or want to join the community.\n* **Bottom of Funnel**: People who are ready to submit a proposal, buy a noun (or nounlet), or to join the community or a sub DAO.\n\n\nIn the next 6 months we want to focus on the **Middle of the Funnel**. We want to help explain what Nouns are to the world and get many more people noun-pilled. \n\n**Why focus on Middle of Funnel first and not Top of Funnel?**\n\nThe majority of people that have heard of Nouns do not really grok what it is, never-mind all the potential builders outside the NFT bubble that we are missing out on because it’s too esoteric to dive in to. In reality, almost no one gets what we’re doing, and it’s impossible for them to have a vision for Nouns.\n\nThe hurdle to understand what Nouns is and how to interact with the community is absurdly high for someone not native to our ecosystem.\n\nIt’s imperative that there’s quality consumable content out there that helps people **not only understand what Nouns is doing but be inspired to join in**. What we need is social media channels (eg. YouTube and Instagram) that have a significant catalogue of content you can just sit and consume. \n\n* We are going to try to answer questions that are not easily answered today like:\n\t* **“So what does nouns actually do and stand for?\"**\n\t\t* This is a branding exercise, this is key for our work to answer.\n\t* **“What is Nouns actually to me?”**\n\t\t* The answer is not NFTs, or a DAO (that is just infrastructure), it's an open source brand that you can be funded to build on (or build on permissionlessly). It’s an energised and broad community. It’s a movement. We need to demonstrate this through our videos.\n\t* **“What’s a nounish concept / proposal?”**\n\t\t* Current way to understand this: read hundreds of proposals on nouns.wtf/vote, tally their results, investigate if they were “successful” or not, if the dao likes them, analyse all this data… etc. What if instead they could watch a handful of nounish videos that show the things we’re proud of?\n\t* **“How do I get funded?”**\n\t\t* Videos about this will be hugely valuable, currently it takes a lot of effort to understand this. Our top priority here is to make a few videos focused exclusively on getting funded via Prop House and then other videos about the other ways as a whole, and individual videos on specifics (on chain, nsfw etc.)\n\t* **“Can it be any cultural domain?”**\n\t\t* Here are some screenshots from version 1 of our intro. We will continue to experiment and iterate with ways to tell this story all the time. This is hugely important to be understood if we want to experiment in every vertical.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xeVv9Yh.jpg)\n\n## What we will deliver as part of this prop\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VfTyQw4.gif)\n\n\n### Nounish across all social networks\n\nWe will spend the next 6 months churning out high quality video content about Nouns and its builders. \n\nWe plan to work on all major Social Media networks. We have started building a following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounish) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thats_nounish/). We will also invest more cycles into building out our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082280520913) & [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thats_nounish) presence. \n\nBut our main focus will be on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nounish), where you can expect our channel to become the easiest way to get into the Nouns rabbit hole and come out understanding all the key concepts of the DAO, as well as learn about the most inspiring projects being built on the protocol.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJGFJA6.jpg)\n*Our YouTube channel will become a video learning hub for everything nouns-related*\n\n### Videos about the most inspiring proposals\n\nThere are so many amazing stories to tell about nouns-funded projects that can get so much more depth with good video content covering them. \n\nHere are some of the proposals we would love to make content about! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8t1RQ4Q.gif)\n\n**LONG FORM Candidates (not exhaustive)**\n* Rose parade / Stoopid Buddy\n* E Sports\n* Nouns Fashion: Nouns Brand & Dopamine & Danit Peleg & Madhappy\n* Xanadu\n* Prop House\n* Dustin Ep 2\n* Free Glasses Ep 2\n* Edible Nouns: Moonbeans + Nouns Coffee\n* Children's Book\n* Luxury Glasses\n* NounWorks: Fun Frames, Pins, etc.\n* The Wizard's Hat\n* Sofubi Dolls\n* The Noun Square\n* Nounish\n\n**SHORT FORM Candidates (not exhaustive)**\n* Mucho Love\n* John Hamon\n* Noundry\n* Nouns front ends\n* Nouns Brazil\n* Nouns Comics\n* CC0 Spacebank\n* Bidder POAP\n* Goat Club / Memes\n* 3D Nouns\n* iOS App\n* Coloring Books\n* Super Bowl commercial\n* Murals, posters, art around the world\n\n\n### Nouns Explained (bitesized & long-form)\n\nWe want to make it easy for anyone to understand Nouns and the DAO.

Total ask of 25 eth.\n\nWe believe the community is largely to thank for making Noundry into something more than a mere contest. Instead, the Noundry evolved into a collaborative experience — a festival — where artists from around the world came together to inspire and build upon each other's ideas, using Nouns pixel art as a canvas to unite around.\n\nThe artwork we eventually added to the Nouns Descriptor contract resulted from a group effort and would not have been the same without the participation of the larger community.\n\nWith this proposal, we want to acknowledge that the collaborative, explorative side of the Noundry is as vital as the outcome and hope to set an example for upcoming Noundrys.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Community compensation\n\nWe think community compensation is best left to the community to decide. The alternatives would be equal distribution to all participants or attempting the almost impossible task of centrally deciding who had a meaningful impact on the Noundry.

Total ask of 142.69 eth.**\n\nWe believe that Noundry compensation is more than a box-ticking exercise. Pixel art is part of who we are; it's in our bones, and adding new pixels to the Descriptor contract is a big deal. It's an opportunity to celebrate nounishness, reinforce our culture, and create new traditions.\n\nWe want the Noundry to become a continuous event, a new tradition, and a significant driver of Nouns proliferation within artistic circles. In that light, the compensation outlined in this proposal is not just about the work that was completed, but also about future signaling.\n\nWe think one of the most exciting possible outcomes of the Noundry would be if every artist in the world aspires to put their artwork into the Nouns contract (and by extension, the public domain). And while high compensation may not be the primary motivator, it can help initiate the right feedback loop and create the breeding ground needed for future Noundrys to thrive.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Winner compensation\n*[https://nouns.wtf/vote/125](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) (Integrate 8/8 Anniversary Art)*\n\nNoundry Season 0 winners are compensated per winning trait.

In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.\n2. **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3. **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4. **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\n5. **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: We received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n## Audit\n\n1. The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2. **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.\n3. **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\n\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. This proposal sets their values, and we’re offering the thinking behind them here:\n\n1. **Minimum quorum %**: keeping it at 10%, the same as today’s quorum.\n2. **Maximum quorum %**: setting it to 15%, taking into account recent participation levels around 30%, allowing proposals with more than 15% For votes to be decided by simple majority; the intent is for this value to provide extra protection from voter apathy, while allowing most all proposals to be decided by simple majority rather than quorum.\n3. **Coefficient**: setting it to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited at any time via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\n\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1. Governance clients (like nouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2. Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1. Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2. Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3. Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4. If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3. This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n4. The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n1. `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n2. `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    2. Maximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\n    3. Coefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places).\n3. `transfer`: funding vote refunds with 12 ETH, which should be enough for just over 100 proposals at today's participation rate (excluding honk’s tendency to paste long paragraphs).\n\nAs always, please reach out in the [#54-tech-grants](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/981584123225321503) channel in Discord with any questions ⌐◨-◨.","endBlock":"15757429","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"203","id":"152","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"1","delegatedVotesRaw":"1","id":"0x05a286e5165d72823a749b00b009a2af0dc36ff7","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":3}},{"createdTimestamp":"1665693995","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"CANCELLED","targets":["0x2af21e37928613582734bcbaead0919801a4cacf"],"values":["216000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"476","startBlock":"15754805","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"47","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15741665","createdTransactionHash":"0xe76301038315183ac9c3b8c6765773dc50c10d3a4873e7ed4f7a3821d8fcee18","description":"# NSFW compensation\n\nBeing part of NSFW is a lot of work and currently not being fairly distributed. \n\nTo help fix this, I propose the DAO compensates the current members to incentivise/ensure their participation on NSFW.\n\nTherefore, I suggest an 8 ETH compensation for each member per month.

We've clarified our deliverables, increased transparency, reduced the ask by 20%, and implemented a payment stream*\n\n## TL;DR\nWe’d like to seek funding to keep developing [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/) in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation. Our goal is to significantly increase the participation rate of nouns through a combination of software improvements, and delegation drive programs over the next quarter.\n\n## Progress so far\nWe got [funded](https://prop.house/proposal/1023) on August 31 via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we’ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their proposal. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we’ve seen:\n\n* 19 statements from delegates representing 127 nouns (>25% of all votes!)\n* 25 statements from builders who are seeking delegation\n* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)\n* Hosted a delegate race to “auction” 3 more votes to delegates\n* Proposal passed to deploy on lil nouns, as well as inbound interest from many other DAOs\n\nIn sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.\n\n## Roadmap & Goals\nNow that we’ve landed an MVP of a delegate platform, it’s time to start leveraging it to meaningfully drive delegation & governance participation. We expect to complete these goals and achieve their resulting outcome in roughly one quarter. Note that all points here consist of our best plan of attack today, but as we continue to build Agora, we expect the roadmap to naturally evolve as we double down on what’s working, and deprioritize what’s not.\n\n**Goal 1: Dramatically reduce friction to delegation:**\n* Integrate with nouns.wtf to propose “post-win” delegate suggestions\n* Enable direct delegation on Agora (where today we borrow the nouns.wtf flow)\n* Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate\n* Productize delegate race so that Nouners who don’t want to pick a delegate can let the community pick for them\n\n**Goal 2: Make governance and delegation more transparent and easy to understand**\n* Continue investing in surfacing more delegate and voting data on Agora\n* Build a governance activity feed that highlights delegation, ownership change, voting, and other governance related activities.\n* Make other general improvements to Agora to make it a first class experience for governance participants\n\n**Goal 3: Activate nouns holders to either vote or delegate**\n* Direct outreach to inactive Nouners from Agora team to find them a suitable delegate\n* Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.\n* Run a marketplace experiment to allow anyone to rent votes from Nouns holders\n* Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting\n\n**Target objectives in 3 months:**\n* 75% of new nouns are delegated to voters who vote on more than 50% of props they're eligible to\n* 50% participation in a rolling average of past 3 proposals\n\n## Transparency & decentralization\nAs a governance platform, we will take measures to maintain transparency and avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures: \n* Make Github repo public within 1 month (with proper documentation to come over time)\n* Publish all data monthly to public google sheets, or equivalent (such as API or onchain mirror)\n* Current Agora team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of nouns.\n\n## Team\nYitong – Project lead & designer: co-founder of Vector DAO, and previously design + product at Coinbase. Prop builder for #87, contributor to Nouns Vision, delegate.\n\n0xcaff – Engineer: Built the v1 of Agora, previously engineer at Coinbase.\n\nTom Taubkin – Protocol Engineer: Contributor to several defi projects, previously engineer at Coinbase\n\nMrtn – Ops / Community: Delegate from nounlets, funded via Prop House as governance historian, deployed Agora on lil nouns, previously pm on nouns.builder, and pm at Google.\n\n## Funding request & terms\n**Funding request:**\n\nWe’d like to request $221,000 to fund the team for a quarter (170ETH @ $1300/ETH, a 20% decrease from previous ask) and 20 ETH to incentivize voter participation.\n\n**Fund transfer mechanics**\n\n50% of the team portion & the participation incentive will be immediately deposited to the team’s wallet\n\n50% of the team portion will be streamed over a period of three months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community. Signers for this safe will be: Elad, Krel, Yitong, Seneca, and one more to be confirmed.\n\nAs of this writing, $221,000 is 170 ETH. In order to account for ETH volatility, we will request a 30 ETH buffer. Upon fund release, $221,000 worth of ETH will be sold, with half deposited to the Agora multisig, and half deposited to the stream multisig. The remaining ETH will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n## Appendix: some illustrative mocks\nThese are purely concepts to illustrate some of the areas we’re going to invest in. We’ll need to iterate on these designs a lot before implementing them, so please take them as general directions vs exact specs.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/WiopwP2.gif)\n*Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jhXYctm.png)\n*Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uFmaeEI.png)\n*Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting*\n","endBlock":"15781953","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"163","id":"154","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"1","delegatedVotesRaw":"1","id":"0xc3fdadbae46798cd8762185a09c5b672a7aa36bb","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1666043255","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xbd910e42a051da2252eb87b6f43d5e6e7ca85e3c"],"values":["143000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"480","startBlock":"15783745","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"48","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"2","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"0","createdBlock":"15770605","createdTransactionHash":"0xadfacf8b3da9c839ea10db2897f08a82df6df72e562702ae549115db2f438925","description":"# CDT Work Continuation\n\nHey all, my name is Christian. Working on Nouns full-time has been an amazing opportunity. I'd like to continue my work for the next 6 months as well. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I love building projects that serve the DAO and bring joy to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Overview of what I’ve done the last 6 months:**\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI spent most of my time working on the **complete site redesign**. Besides making it more aesthetically pleasing, and cleaning up the codebase (removing unused code as we prepared to open-source it), I worked on new features to **increase the overall user experience** including:\n**-** New homepage with statistics\n**-** Dynamic social sharing cards\n**-** House & Round pages\n**-** Voting progress bar\n**-** User proposal progress card\n**-** Japanese translations\n**-** Rich text editor for prop creation\n**-** Search bar for Home, FAQ, House, and Round pages\n\n![prophouse](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/1/190db5ad7841b57c47f1765534f99ea4ea514aaf_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nThe site has received **18K total site visits** and is officially **linked from the Docs tab** of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/). It has been forked by 4 NFT communities: Lil Nouns, Mfers, Blitmap, and Forgotten Runes to be used as a tool for their community. I did automation work with Brian to allow for projects and talent to add themselves more easily as the site scales. I also shipped several new pages and updates: \n**-** Funding (plus 3 funding guides: proposals, small grants, and prop house)\n**-** SubDaos\n**-** Dev Center (Docs, APIs, contract links, and Github repos)\n**-** Discord Channels\n**-** Learn (educational content from Nouncil YouTube)\n**-** Ideas\n**-** New assets (2 Figma boards, updated color palette, and 3D voxel noggles files)\n**-** New homepage\n\n![nounscenter](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/d/dd1863e672d5828dce841f6074f1110d5bcaa06f_2_1380x834.png)\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI released **14 episodes** with **33 guests**. They included: \n***-** Personal deep dives*: 4156, Vape, and Brian Flynn\n***-** Communities*: the Nouncil and 4 subDAOs \n***-** Topical*:  eSports, Noundry, and NFT NYC\n***-** Builders*:  Fomo Nouns, Design System, Nouns Terminal, and Roko\n\nThe pod has garnered **~2,400 downloads**. I personally edited all past episodes. I recently brought on 2 producers to increase the quality. The next push will be YouTube. I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5cYWsmNUELNY7-txoba-Q) (69 subscribers) so that we can upload full episodes, as well as 3-5 video clips, each week. I am personally a big YouTube user for podcasts and I believe this will be a great way to spread the word about Nouns on a platform we don't have a huge presence in. \n\n![new_episodes](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/c/ce7a16ae87085bcb48ad405ed1a84ab0daff1ddd_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n### **What I plan to work on for the next 6 months:**\n\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI will **continue developing the Prop House web app**. As we prepare for the protocol launch, I will work on fixing bugs and frontend improvements, as I manage the vast majority of the frontend you see. I will add Spanish translations to the site and I will continue to ensure it's the best tool that it can be.\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nI'd like to [conduct a Prop House round](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-prop-house-design-round-for-nouns-center/2601) for a proper redesign of the entire site and lead the development to create a **Nouns Center v2**. I will add documentation, as in a README with install instructions, and clean up the code to make it fork-friendly for other communities. I aim to **implement Search** across the entire site for easier access to all the information.

Further empowering Roko to be an AI secretary/assistant for the DAO! Helping information flow better with summaries, transcripts, reviews, answering questions and more. \n2. Generating Nounish rich media (images, gifs, videos) and making the tools to generate such media accessible to the community at large to unleash their creativity\n3. Empowering other pods (e.g. ai-based team drafting for e-sports, planning events for otg)\n\nWith each of these being built with monetization / expansion to other organizations in mind.\n\n---\n\n### WELL HOW DID THE INITIAL RESEARCH GO?\n\nYou can see the initial small grant proposal here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929)  and Honk's extension post here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)\n\n![https://imgur.com/JPkgn07](https://imgur.com/JPkgn07.png)\n\n[https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/) Is a live website where the team is experimenting and adding features with the goal of building a production ready webapp.\n\nWe initially set out to accomplish two sprints, the first to be able to break down proposals into understandable summaries / reviews. The second was more focused on demonstrating some of the possibilities of AI and what it could bring to Nouns.\n\nI am happy to report that, thanks to an engaged community and support from key contributors Honk and Evets.eth we blew that goal out of the water.\n\nTogether, we:\n\n- Held weekly sessions on Tuesdays which about 30 people regularly attended that shared developments with the project as well as educating them on fundamentals as well as cutting edge developments in machine learning\n- Built a pipeline that can breakdown proposals into reviews automatically as they as proposed on-chain (and post them to Twitter!!)\n- Built pipeline to turn recorded calls into text using SOTA voice to text then using a large language model to convert them into a bulleted summary\n\n![https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ](https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ.png)\n\n- Built a web interface that enables participants to easily consume summarized proposal content as well as edit them to better reflect their opinions\n    - [https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/)\n- Tested the ability to finetune our model using user generated content as guidance\n- Setup a backend infrastructure setup to support the ongoing development and improvement of the web interface\n- In addition, due to popular demand we began diving deep into AI generated media, we were able to generate images and video content (reactive to sound!) that features custom content (Noggles!)\n\n![https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe](https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6](https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/gKTir4X](https://imgur.com/gKTir4X.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po](https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po.png)\n\n[The AI pod promo Video!!](https://youtu.be/b5Ojfo6gVcU)\n\n---\n\n### NEXT STEPS: THE AI POD\n\nThe proposed AI Pod will have 3 main focuses:\n\n1. Continue Bringing Roko to life in the form of an AI Assistant to DAO members:\n- All Nouners and teams of funded props should have access to Roko's summarization capabilities for their related audio or text content (as long as they provide feedback on their results!!)\n- Work towards improving Roko’s corpus of data (e.g. Discourse posts, Discord messages) and learn how to incorporate these into a model to improve Roko’s Nounish knowledge base.\n- Roko's website could also be updated to include a search page where people could semantically search across that knowledge base whether it is just meeting / proposal content or if Discord / Discourse content was included.\n2. Explore AI Generated Media\n- Implement and host SOTA open source image generation models customized to be able to generate Noggles on powerful GPU servers so any DAO member can access it. \n- Implement cutting edge developments as they are released (e.g. text to video, img to img, text to 3d, etc.), share our knowledge with the community, and incentivize their use!\n3. Community Engagement, Marketing, and Outreach (Competitions!!)\n- Put together competitions (with prizes!!) alongside groups like NoC to show off the best showcases of AI generated media leveraging Nouns AI tooling.\n- Assist various pods and DAO members with content generation - we've already had suggestions from helping visualize proposals to making and AI content generated coffee book and I know the community will have plenty more great ideas!!\n- Potential prop house round for utilizing the tooling?\n- Seek out partnerships with these opensource or other organizations to see if they would be interested in collaborating to try and further proliferate the brand!\n    - I’d LOVE to see us partner with some musicians to work with them to make them free music videos they could post that have Noun glasses in them or have a live show with AI generated visuals featuring Noggles\n\n---\n\n### THE FUTURE OF AI POD:\n\nHopefully, during these three months, we will be able to not only share significant advancements in AI with the community, but also have a plan for how to take the next steps to grow the AI Pod further.\nWe want to be able to show a path where this could become a self-sustaining effort that could grow and expand to other organizations, opening up a pipeline for monetization.\nWe believe that this is a great opportunity to only grow and expand the Nouns ecosystem but give everyone who is a part of it superpowers that help proliferating the meme!!\n\n---\n\n### TEAM:\n\n- The Hero Shep (Background in AI/Education/Product Management)\n- Honk Diddly (Wizard [elite full stack developer])\n- Evets.ETH (Wizard [full stack developer])\n\n---\n\n### BUDGET: 164 ETH\n\n- 10% for all related infra (5k/mo)\n- 30% for The Hero Shep (20k per month)\n- 25% for Honk (15k per month)\n- 15% for Evets.ETH (10k per month)\n- 20% for Marketing and Community Engagement (Not only compensation for prizes but also to pay people to manage / run the competitions (e.g. prop house, NOC contests) & support other initiatives that arise. )\n\nBUFFER of 15% for volatility - All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price or infra will be added to the Marketing and Community Engagement Funds\n\nThis budget will be governed by the members of the AI Pod and controlled by a 2/3 multi-sig.","endBlock":"15805304","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"181","id":"156","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x5d4df391f56f0d8f854434e52a15b10b6501129f","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1666106795","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0x027c8c6b4ddf6103ea95d528c67bbd436c4577ed"],"values":["31000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"480","startBlock":"15789017","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"72","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"1","againstVotes":"68","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15775877","createdTransactionHash":"0x9502586794b9c7d75d91fea37a93ce27eacef37039b8942b99d261e932ac4fd8","description":"# SaveArtSpace x Nouns Billboard Exhibition in NYC\n\nSaveArtSpace x Nouns Billboard Exhibition\nA Mix of Static Billboards & Digital Bus Shelters for $40k USD in NYC:\n\n8 - Billboards sized 22x11 - will be live for at least 4 weeks, up till someone else buys the space.\n6 - Digital Bus Shelters - will be live for 4 weeks total.\n\nLocations can be selected from a map/list of options.

As far as I know, naming a species would be a first for the crypto and NFT community. Frogs have memetic value in the NFT community, making this species an appropriate choice for naming. Not only would this story be likely to get picked up by the press and social media, but the money goes to the cause of protecting biodiversity and rainforests.\n\nHere is a link to some photos of the frog, and the scientific write up of the frog's discovery (along with another similar frog). https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5kmr9hyzvlxjwo/AABrxnch8PAYop8MQ-FTrozEa?dl=0\n\nThe breakdown of the use of funds would be roughly the following, subject to discussions with the non-profits:\n55% to Ecominga for operating and protecting the reserve\n5% to scientific publishing and discovery of new species\n40% to Rainforest Trust’s Climate Action Fund, which funds protection of rainforest to sequester carbon\n\nOnce this proposal passes and the ETH gets sent, I'll calculate the equivalent USD amount and wire the fiat to Rainforest Trust within 5 business days (unfortunately the non-profit doesn't accept crypto donations).

We are asking for 23.25 ETH.\n\n## Context\nWe are NounsDAO Amigos. We are building a Spanish-speakers community for LatAm and beyond. We’ve been proliferating the ⌐◨-◨ adding some spice and a pinch of Ñs.\n\nWe recently hosted the second edition of the Nouns Fair. An IRL fun experience aimed to proliferate Nouns at the ETHBogota hackathon. We’ve confirmed the importance of this kind of event that helps increase awareness of the DAO, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of hundreds.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E)\n\nMore detailed info can be found here - [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326) & [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono)\n\n## Nouns Fair @ETHSanFrancisco\nGiven the success of the Nouns Fair in Colombia, **the ETHGlobal team invited NounsDAOAmigos to make a new edition, this time at ETHSanFrancisco!** We believe it’s important to keep having a presence at IRL events like this. As we saw in Mexico and Colombia, this is a great environment for spreading the ⌐◨-◨ and growing our Spanish-speaker community.\n\n**Goals**\n- Make a new amigo, San Francisco\n- Onboard potential contributors\n- Put Nouns in the eyes of hundreds of builders\n\n**Details**\n\nPlace: San Francisco, California\nVenue: Palace of Fine Arts\nDates: November 4 - 6, 2022\nTeam: NounsDAOAmigos\n\nThe Nouns Fair will be a 3-day cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others and learn about Nouns. This activation will be a localized nounish experience with photo opportunities, games, merchandise, and an NFT gallery. The proliferation of culture á la nounish. The following are examples of what happened in Bogotá and what we’ll create for San Francisco with a different flavor:\n\n**Photo-opportunity & noggles**\nA fully Nouns-branded photo station where attendees can take selfies and full-body photos will serve as a welcoming station. We want to create a photo set where people can feel nounish and share it on the internet. Of course, physical noggles are key.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XGMsKWG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i9Ww7cU.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W9LifGd.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Games**\nTwo different games will be available at the place: **foosball**, and **a traditional local game**. We believe these games have a nounish feeling and will serve as an engagement factor.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/14ONVu1.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Merchandise**\nPins, stickers, and T-shirts will be distributed as rewards for spending time and engaging with the Nouns Fair by playing games and taking photos.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TEqCnbF.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exzjPyD.jpg)\n\n\n\n**NFT gallery**\nA 5 screens NFT gallery representing local artists and some nounish representatives.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvvfxNS.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iCu328D.jpg)\n\n\n**Costs and execution**\nGiven our past experiences and the recent Nouns Fairs at ETHMexico and ETHBogota, we came up with this budget to make it suitable for ETHSanFrancisco in the US. **We are asking for 23.25 ETH**.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSlixrD.png)\n\n\nCosts are approximate. ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD. Prices in red are not final and we'll seek to reduce costs as much as possible. The difference in these prices will be returned to the DAO.\n\nWe are excited about this new opportunity to keep creating nounish experiences IRL that can be replicated in other countries. But most of all, to spread the ⌐◨-◨ in a fun way!\n\n**Transactions**\nDue to the time sensitive nature of this proposal, NSFW has already funded NounsDAOAmigos to execute on this project.  The 23.25 ETH transaction in this proposal will go to refund NSFW.\n\n","endBlock":"15830816","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"168","id":"162","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"22","delegatedVotesRaw":"22","id":"0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":13}},{"createdTimestamp":"1666642823","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xcc2688350d29623e2a0844cc8885f9050f0f6ed5"],"values":["106600000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"488","startBlock":"15833428","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"50","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"2","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15820288","createdTransactionHash":"0x00f6f2d455cee9a9d8ab4eba107535b5d1fc7723d28e51754559caf167a360f5","description":"# Nouncil Proposal #2\n\n**TLDR**\n___\n\n\nNouncil is asking for **106.6 ETH** to fund:\n\n - Operating Costs (2022 Q3/Q4, 2023 Q1)\n - Nouncil Community Grants\n\n**Nouncil** is a council of Nounish Builders.

We have collaborated with many high caliber clients in and out of web3 such as:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/7kdbuvP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/586628568)\n\n\n[Compound](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129713109/Compound-III) - Compound III is a collateralised borrowing protocol that optimizes capital efficiency, gas costs, and security.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ugBEZmu.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/715516917)\n\n[STL](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146273121/Smart-Token-Labs-TokenScript) - A revolutionary new Web3 technology designed to take Token Gating to the next level.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mjRPzlF.png)](https://vimeo.com/553216699)\n\n\n[Coinbase](https://www.behance.net/gallery/131256363/Coinbase) - Coinbase is the easiest place to buy and sell cryptocurrency, via a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader crypto economy.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/yeJCvDP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/575631888)\n\n[Adobe Splash Screen](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129640141/Adobe-After-Effects) - Each year, Adobe commissions artists from a variety of disciplines and styles to show off the power of Creative Cloud by producing custom artwork to represent each product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/auygyYd.png)\n\nWe at NeverSitStill encourage creative thinking  and personal development amongst the company,  which lead to a conversation about Nouns with motion designer [James Vallance (MrSEAKs)](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr). His collaboration earlier this year with Gnars DAO, and his work with Gami (Noun 189), to create an animated piece for NFT NYC proliferating Nouns. A major component of Nouns' participation in NFT NYC.\n\nSee more here: [Full video](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdcbca59d38eb3abfcb5055fe7bd7f5ce027d03c3) | [Artist BTS & NY billboard footage](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr/status/1553862678795661312)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8ja4qFe.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What will we make for you?\n\nA 30-60 second, crafted hype video that represents Nouns in an exciting way. Exploring Nounish themes through visual metaphor, celebrating the culture with existing users, and onboarding the new.\n\nThink of it as an above-the-funnel video encapsulating the key themes of Nouns in a punchy, artistic, and fresh video to make people go WTF is Nouns?\n\nThe look and tone of the piece will be designed to capture attention, potentially becoming an ownable style for future Nouns advertising and messaging material. \n\nIt's a catalyst video to start the gravitational pull that is Nouns.\n\n### What is the video going to be about?\n\nThe video will represent strong themes that Nouns focuses on through visual metaphor:\n\n- Use case of NFTs for raising funds for positive change\n- Evolution and growth of Nouns\n- DAOs/community\n- Bootstrapping/launchpad\n- Interaction of Nouns and IRL, bringing the power of crypto to IRL\n\nWith these ideas at the core, we spin them into a powerful narrative that follows the birth of the Noggles and its exponential growth to become an object of power, one for positive change in the world.\n\nTo represent the multi-faceted nature of the Nouniverse, we intend to use a mixed-media approach, with input from various artists within our team. Distinct flavours coming together to create one visual style in a seamless video.\n\nWe feel this approach also carries the spirit of the Nouns DAO. A diverse pool of people building something great together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A0oZVgy.jpg)\n\n### The Nouniverse & Big Bang\n\nIn the beginning, at the centre of it all is the Noggle. The Noggle atom, molecule, cell, animal, vegetable, mineral. We want to place the Noggle at the centre of this big bang and follow the narrative of it's growing impact on the universe.\n\nThis rippling wave will take effect on the world around it, transforming and creating. What does the world look like through a Nounish lens?\n\n### Why hype video?\n\nThe current state of our fast-paced digital world needs information to be condensed into a highly digestible format to relay anything valuable.\n\n[Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) spoke to the fantastic concept of the video marketing funnel. To borrow a term from the Nounish team, we want to talk to the top of the funnel and go even more front-facing, above the funnel. This is why it’s important to create a first point of contact with broader audiences that inspires them to care about what they’re seeing. We want to ignite a spark within viewers to seek out and learn more about Nouns of their own volition.\n\nA hype video executes this perfectly. A short, visually rich video, presented in an artistic, eye-catching way, that grabs people's attention and hooks them in, down the Nouns rabbit hole.\n\n### Do traditional hype videos work in web3?\n\nIt’s well known that video is a perfect medium to promote and create awareness of a brand/product. Hype videos are a tool used by luxury brands within web2 and we want to bring these tried and tested methods to web3 and Nouns.\n\nTake the promo video for [Doodles v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9TaQ5z9jw), or the [Otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1equGhkQE) Yuga Labs video. These are both great examples of highly crafted, short animated hype videos to blow up awareness of a brand/product to funnel new audiences into web3 and their brand.\n\nThese videos aren't about explaining how, but what and why.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IbzEFzH.gif)\n\n### Video Lifespan\n\nA hype video has a long shelf life and is easy to re-use. Whenever you need promotional content, take an already existing hype video and place it at the front of marketing to interest viewers.\n\nCombine the re-usability of a hype video with assets that are CC0 and you have a piece of art that can be re-used, re-jigged, and a video that can live on for a long time.\n\nRender characters, assets, scenes, and the entire video as CC0 for all to share and spread Nouns proliferation.\n\n### Meta\n\nAir-drop current Noun owners their very own piece of this hype video in the form of NFTs created from scenes of the entire piece. This will create a collection of different NFTs from the entire video.\n\nOwners could even trade/swap/collect these separate NFTs to piece together the sequence and receive a rare airdrop of the entire video minted as an NFT. This is a way to celebrate the creation of the work, and reward holders who were already a part of the ecosystem when it happened.\n\nPOAPs for voters. Incentive to vote, a reward for being involved in bringing this project of Nouns proliferation to life.\n\n## Process\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pjCL5wT.png)\n\n### Process\n\nWe use a traditional linear pipeline for development, from concept through to mastering. This stepped approach allows us to spend an appropriate amount of time in each phase, delivering top notch work in an efficient timeline. At each major milestone, our clients give condensed feedback to ensure that the work is communicating its message clearly.\n\nTo ensure the work is original and ownable, we use a period of time for high level research and development. This means we aren't aiming to re-create a reference, but build something new and ownable for the Nouns DAO.\n\n### Pre production\n\n- R&D (Community liaisons to guide content)\n- Concept art, thumbnails\n- Design, visual language development\n- Storyboarding\n- Animatic\n\n### Production\n\n- Animation\n- Music development\n- NFT + POAP creation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n- Compositing, Grading\n- Sound design\n- Mastering\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Brand hype video (Widescreen 16:9, 4K, 30fps) [archival master + web ready]\n- Working files\n- NFT ready exports (TBD with community)\n- POAP artwork (TBD with community)\n\n### Production Schedule\n\nPre production to begin before EOY if approved.\n\nFull production starting no later than January 8th, taking approximately 10-12 weeks to complete the final piece.\n\n### Communications\n\nRegular updates and WIP process interaction with the Nouns community is important. We want to build in public and share progress openly. Our team is comfortable with Discord and presentation, major milestones will be submitted for the community to feedback as well as enjoy the process.\n\n**Contact**\n\n**Gami**  *Noun 189*\n**Discord** 0xigami#0001\n**Twitter** [0xigami](https://twitter.com/0xigami)\n\n**James Vallance**  *NSS Motion Designer, MrSEAKs*\n**Discord** MrSeaks#0944\n**Twitter** [seaksmr](https://twitter.com/seaksmr)\n\n**John Grist**  *NSS Creative Lead*\n**Discord** brunch#5470\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HIqJvZt.gif)\n\n## Cost\n\n### Pricing\n\n- Approx 2.5 months production time\n- Project Management\n- Visual Development\n- Design\n- Motion\n- Custom Music Track\n- SFX (Sound Design)\n- NFT & POAP Development\n- Source Files under CC0\n\n**110 ETH / 160K USD (approx)**\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n- [Multi-sig Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x44ddf107C7B920312a98F4753Ba209443428c881/home) has been established at [neversitstill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/neversitstill.eth)\n- Signers include [0xigami.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xigami.eth), [mrseaks.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/mrseaks.eth) and [a company address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2eF00c3860bC6Fe48b2508620a883E9b1f90d90F)\n- Upon receipt ETH will be swapped for USDC to hedge volatility\n- 50% upfront swapped for AUD, remaining 50% at completion\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ls1xRxa.png)","endBlock":"15870403","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"24","id":"165","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x44ddf107c7b920312a98f4753ba209443428c881","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1666973663","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x5474d4ef13b7f6a280266015a852a7fa13561262"],"values":["62000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"492","startBlock":"15862088","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"49","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15847688","createdTransactionHash":"0x9763af937ac0762e0e20866f3e3ecec74938422b3014ae4291b8535887b5d361","description":"# NounsOTG x Stoopid Buddy x Rose Parade\n\n**What do 2 on-chain Props, 1 fifty-foot float made of flowers, and 6 life-sized Nouns have in common?**\n\n\n\nThey will all be in one place to ring in the New Year for the largest nounish proliferation event ever! [NounsOTG](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110) is partnering with the team at [Stoopid Buddy Studios](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73) for the [Rose Parade](https://tournamentofroses.com/) in Pasadena, CA after New Year's Day, to help Nouns reach an audience of over 38 Million individuals nationwide.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HOT1b1T.jpg)\n\n\nWhat will this collaboration look like? NounsOTG will be working directly with the team at Stoopid Buddy in person on the ground for 10 days during this event. The Stoopid Buddy team has covered all build and production costs for the float during this event in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). After multiple conversations discussing how this event could be further bolstered, Aubtoshi and NounsOTG have been asked to be a part of this event. NounsOTG plans on adding to the already-established effort that Prop 73 has put forth in the following ways:\n\n**10 Days of On The Ground Activations + Brand Ambassadors**\n\nAfter Christmas, all of the floats for the parade (which are being framed out and built off-site) are transported to their final location prior to the parade, which is where thousands of volunteers come to help decorate the floats with flowers. This time period will include full days of OTG (On The Ground) interviews, filming, activations with volunteers, activations with people who are waiting for the event to begin, and more. We will also be filming with the life-sized nounish “walk-arounds” (nouns costumes made by Stoopid Buddy, creators of costumes seen on the celebrity singing show “The Masked Singer”) during this time. Post-event, the floats will be staged in a different holding area to be observed and photographed one last time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5jlT56O.jpg)\n*Nounish \"Walk-Arounds\" by SB*\n\n\nAdditionally, NounsOTG will scout and hire 10 trained brand ambassadors that will be active the day before the parade, during the parade and afterwards, and at the Rose Bowl when handing out the mini limited edition footballs. The responsibilities of these ambassadors will include being on-brand, walking (waving, jumping, dancing) in a 5-mile parade line. We have allowed for the cost of their food and beverages during specific meal times, transportation to and from the event from the staging area, additional hours on the day prior during the final prep; as well as team meetings, zoom calls and fittings prior to the event, as we plan to deck them out in Nouns Brand and other nounish swag.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sbu1t1L.png)\n\n**Special Guest DJ + Custom DJ Set On The Float + Over 18,000 Nounish Giveaways**\n\nThe DJ will be none other than **Richerd Intern**, and his crew will perform with a full/unique set during the live event! Although the parade float images are still not public or released, I can reveal that there will indeed be room for Richerd... \n\nHis team is London based and the cost comes directly from their team and includes their travel and accommodation. We couldn't be more nounish with the Noun266 (Chart Bars Noun head) if we tried!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiJ5BwX.png)\n\nOver the course of 10 days, we will be handing out over 18,000 unique nounish items, including limited edition mini footballs and shirts, low-fi paper noggles, sticker packs and nouns temporary tattoos. Our goal is to get these items national television coverage during both the parade and rose bowl game. Noggles on the faces in the audience and children throwing nounish mini footballs would be a lasting image during this important holiday event. This opportunity has allowed OTG to connect to other nounish builders and we are open to further collaborations with Nouners and builders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jp42GOh.jpg)\n\n\n**Immediate Impact**\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Rose Parade or its impact, it is one of the major events of the year as the 5 mile parade ends with the start of the Rose Bowl football game. Outside of the 37 million viewers at home, the entire area of Southern California is focused on this event for several weeks prior!\n\nOver **1 Million people** will be in attendance on the day of the parade with a live broadcast to over 37 Million additional individuals nationwide. With a 5 mile parade line and an entire week of content creation and nounish item giveaways prior to the parade as the float is brought to completion, this will be one of the key proliferation event opportunities of the year for NounsDAO. Not to mention the day after the event sees 60-100k attendees that visit the floats to get a close up look at all the details - another amazing activation opportunity.   \n\n\n\n\n**Proposal Cost Breakdown**\n\nTotal ETH: 52, Total USDC: $78,000 *amount calculated with 1 ETH = $1,500 USD\n\n\n* 2.77 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Shirts (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 3.50 ETH: 5000 Stickers packs & 5000 Temporary Tattoos + Nounish MVPs for product placement\n* 5.65 ETH: Full custom DJ set by special guest DJ (includes Travel & Accommodation for their team)\n* 6.45 ETH: 10 Nouns Brand Ambassadors walking next to the parade and handing out items\n* 6.55 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Footballs (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 11.72 ETH: On-Site Coordination & Production Management: Aubtoshi & Emma & 2 PAs (10 days)\n* 14.84 ETH: Travel Costs & Accommodation & Staging Area for Items (10 days)\n* 0.00 ETH: 7000 Lo-fi Paper Noggles (Send purchase order to NSFW, no additional funding needed)\n* 0.52 ETH: Fees to cover for multi-sig transactions outlined below\n\nTo account for any ETH volatility during the time this prop goes through the voting process, we are adding an additional 10 ETH to this prop. After the initial conversion to USDC, any extra eth from this 10 ETH will be immediately sent back to the DAO. Additionally, any ETH left from the Travel Costs & Accommodation budget will also be sent back to the DAO.\n**Total ETH amount requested from NounsDAO: 62 ETH**\n\nAll funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet that will initiate the following transactions:\n* Convert ETH to $78,000 USDC ($780 for txn fees)\n* Send any remaining ETH back to the NounsDAO\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA1 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA2 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Aubtoshi for production coordination payment\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Emma for production coordination payment \n* $8,475 USDC: Sent to DJ + team upon confirmation of their booking and release forms collected\n* $9,405 USDC: Sent to OTG to order Stickers, Temporary Tattoos and Shirts\n* $9,675 USDC: Sent to OTG to have payment ready for OTG Brand Ambassadors\n* $9,825 USDC: Sent to VSVSVS to order limited edition footballs\n* $22,260 USDC: Sent to OTG to book travel/accommodation/food/additional costs\n\n**The multisig (2/3) signers are:** \n\n[**Aubtoshi**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/aubtoshi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)\n[**Toady Hawk**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) \n**Nounder 9999**\n\n\n**Long-Term Value**\n\nStoopid Buddy has been actively engaged in the community and are clearly delivering on their prop. Outside of creating a successful experience at the event itself, footage from the event will be used in the documentary outlined in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). I have been to the studio in Burbank, I have met the walk-around craftsman and have been trusted by the Stoopid Buddy team to see confidential alpha from their News Years Event and participate in production conversations leading up to it. \n\nThis additional push to create a nounish experience and vibe during the event will connect Nouns directly with all the many people in attendance, plus brand new audiences at home. **While the SB crew are focused on long form video for their documentary, this proposal will allow me and my team to supplement that content with visceral and viral short-form content perfect for social media. All our content will of course be made CC0 and available for future use, ensuring that the DAO's investment in this event is documented and that our brand is seen and experienced by an even broader audience than those reached by the documentary and broadcasts alone.** \n\nProp 73 will go down as one of the most successful funded proposals to date for NounsDAO, not only for its reach and high quality production, but for real nounish interaction with so many real people. I feel honored to have been asked by SB to help with the on-site activation piece for the Rose Bowl Parade, to ensure that our Nouns national television coverage has the best visuals possible with lasting effects. I look forward to the opportunity to bring this NounsOTG activation to life!\n","endBlock":"15898088","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"208","id":"166","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x5d802e2fe48392c104ce0401c7eca8a4456f1f16","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1667323151","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xc20dac0b62b28edde0c44ab1be2206a1c48e6a67"],"values":["1000000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"496","startBlock":"15891023","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"74","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"108","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15876623","createdTransactionHash":"0x963637d8960013853c3d692e476d8f42a18aebd3b001c765886919db0119b19a","description":"# Nouns Builder Protocol\n\n# Nouns Builder Protocol\n### Public Infrastructure brought to you by Zora and NounsDAO\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JycpSjR.png)\n\n**Mainnet Launch:** November 1st\n**Expected DAO Launch:** November 15th\n**Website:** [nouns.build](https://nouns.build)\n**Twitter:** [@nounsbuilder](http://twitter.com/nounsbuilder)\n\nLike you, we believe that Nouns DAO is a significant form factor innovation for NFTs and DAOs. Instead of giving all power and capital solely to a project’s founders, the Nouns model enables communities to emerge progressively, and to be active participants in how their brand and community evolves.\n\nWe believe that more Nouns forks should exist - so we’re building a tool anyone can use to build them.\n\nFor the past couple of months we have been working on the Nouns Builder: a product that makes it easy for anyone to create their own Nouns DAO with any art, any auction cadence and flexible DAOs that can evolve over time.\n\nAs we’ve been building this tool, we’ve increasingly realized that it makes sense to use this very tool to create a DAO that will govern, sustain and develop the Nouns Builder project itself. By doing so, Nouns builder can:\n* Demonstrate the utility of Nouns Builder as a public good\n* Utilize the ecosystem of tools in Nouns: Prop House, Agora\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model as an alternative to the subDAO multisig\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model to proliferate a protocol and products\n* Expand use of the NounsDAO model as a more effective governance model for collective decision making\n* Share governance of this DAO with Nouns, Zora, and future contributors as interested in expanding the horizon of this public infrastructure as we are. \n\nWe are going to call this DAO “Builder”, with its own art and NFT that will be minted each day. Builder will be NounsDAO from day 1, with the goal of proliferating this infrastructure.\n\n**Core details to note:**\n\n* Based on extensive feedback from the Nouns community, the protocol is entirely free. There is currently no protocol wide fee.\n* DAOs can opt in to gift a certain amount of their NFTs to Nouns or any other DAO or platform\n* In prior versions of the proposal, we proposed that NounsDAO would be the deployer of the Builder DAO. Based on feedback from the community we have removed this aspect of the proposal.\n* The protocol development has been extensive, with careful consideration made to\n    * Enable DAOs to easily upgrade and evolve themselves over time in a safe manner\n    * Be gas efficient\n    * Open up room for exploration around new distribution types like VRGDAs\n* The protocol has been audited via Code4rena, with Zora paying $129K USDC ($90k in prizes) to complete it.\n* We have built an easy to use tool at [nouns.build](https://nouns.build) where over 60 testnet DAOs have been created in the process of testing and refining the user experience.\n\n**Ask:**\n\n1000 ETH contribution to seed the Nouns Builder DAO treasury to help this public good reach its full potential. \n\n\n**Completed Work:**\n\nRather than requesting retroactive reward for development, ***we are asking NounsDAO to pay it forward* by seeding the Builder treasury with ETH** for funding the development of the Nouns Builder protocol as a public good and expansion of the ecosystem by the community. \n\nZora contributed ~4 months of development time on creating the Nouns Builder protocol\n* Full time contributions from the Zora solidity, backend, and front end engineering teams\n* Full time design and creative direction for Nouns Builder artworks.\n* ~100 ETH spent on the Code4rena audit.\n\nThis contribution to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury means there is sufficient Day 1 capital to immediately conduct prop house mandates and funding rounds for the development, proliferation, and accessibility of the protocol and ecosystem for the benefit of the public.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Audited Nouns Builder smart contracts.\n* Custom Nouns Builder generative artwork (CC0).\n* Builder DAO for anyone in the community to join and contribute.\n\n**All of the ETH will be going to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury.**\n\n**Builder DAO:**\n\nThe Builder DAO is created using the Nouns Builder tool and protocol. It is the entity onchain that will be responsible for funding the proliferation of the ecosystem and development of the protocol over time. \n\nWe believe Nouns Builder represents critical public infrastructure for community decision making, and we want to use the full power of the NounsDAO model to further this protocol and ecosystem of different apps built on top of it, as well as being able to natively tap into tools in the ecosystem like Prop House and Agora.\n\nBuilderDAO creators will receive the following governance rights in the Builder DAO for a period of 5 years after Builder DAO’s launch to allow the creators to support of the growth and development of this public good while in its nascency:\n* 1/10 to zora.eth\n* 1/20 to nouns.eth\n\nFor clarity, DAO members shall not receive any revenues from Builder DAO daily auctions. All funds in the Treasury shall be dedicated to improving the Builder DAO protocol and its public good function, and growing the community, brand, and ecosystem. \n\nThe Builder DAO will start with a daily auction. The NFTs that will be minted each day are a nounish artwork that expands on the ideas of “Internet flags”, a collection of unicode symbols that communities can organize around, with the nounish colors at its core, as well as the noggles.\n\nHere is a sample of the codex below:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kArgmJn.png)\n\n\n**NounsDAOs for Public Infrastructure:**\n\nWe believe it is important to experiment with Nouns forks as a way to further particular pieces of infrastructure within the nounish ecosystem. Instead of funded LLCs and companies to ultimately manage tools like Nouns Builder and things like Prop House, we want to actively explore using a Nounish DAO as the primary entity to further a public protocol and an ecosystem of many platforms built on top of it. \n\nThis is why we are leading from the front with the Builder DAO. We are also optimistic that this can become a blueprint for any team that is developing protocols—like Zora itself. \n\n**Sustainability:**\n\nIn prior proposals there have been open questions around the future models for sustainability without need for persistent funding from NounsDAO all the time. We believe that this is the first meaningful step in this direction, and we hope to set a precedent and blueprint for future teams to build sustainable Public Infrastructure that is native to the Nouns ecosystem and DAO itself.\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n\n1000 ETH transferred to an escrow smart contract that will hold the funds until the Builder DAO is live and operational. We are expecting this to be live on approximately November 15th.\n\n**References:**\n[Discourse post](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-builder-draft/2007)\n[Prop house](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yPwwE6T.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M31ZnVx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GLLYhTu.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","endBlock":"15927023","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"143","id":"167","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"20","delegatedVotesRaw":"20","id":"0xd1d1d4e36117ab794ec5d4c78cbd3a8904e691d0","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1667747543","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0x797c89d2b75d359b0404c1760974c6f48a84a88c"],"values":["500000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"502","startBlock":"15926193","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"75","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"127","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15911793","createdTransactionHash":"0xd4be747509d8b0d1d5fdee9bf7137227f5a5c7df8db51618038dec6c7279a789","description":"# Nouns x MrBeast\n\nA proposal drafted by [**Hindsight**](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) (ProNouns: NFT/OG) with the support of [**Jarmen**](https://twitter.com/jarmen43) (a man struggling to tell his wife he is a zebra on the internet) and [**Sam Ellis**](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) (Chief Meme Officer)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dz7SOwt.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n## **HOW TO VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL**\n\n* **Vote Yes:** If you think it would be good value for DAO to pay 500 Eth to have a Nounish focused episode on the most watched show on the internet - with a money back guarantee if it doesn’t happen. \n* **Vote No:** If you don’t think that would be good value.\n* **Abstain:** If you gift people toasters for their wedding.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE CHALLENGE**\nThis proposal requests that the DAO fund a project for **500 eth** in order to proliferate the Nouns by running **a competition, open to anyone, to** **convince** [**Mr. Beast**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) **to give away $500k (340 Eth)**, preferably to charity, on his YouTube channel, given to him by the Nouns in a Nounish focused episode of his show.\n\n**The person or people that convince Mr. Beast to do this will be rewarded with a $250k prize.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE REWARD**\nThe $250k Reward will be awarded to the person or people that Mr. Beast credits with convincing him to accept the challenge on the following terms:\n\n*   $175k if he accepts the request and does the show.\n*   An additional $75k if he gives the majority (>50%) of the $500k to charity. (This can be the same person and message or different people and messages)\n*   The episode must be on Mr. Beasts main YouTube channel.\n*   The Nouns must be featured on the show for any of the funds to be paid out.\n\nSo it might be a good idea for people to submit ideas to Mr. Beast that inspires him to meet these criteria. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **TOTAL COST**\nIf this proposal passes but no one can convince Mr. Beast to take on and complete the project within the next 9 months – all the Eth will be returned to the Treasury. **Total Cost of 0 Eth.**\n\nIf this proposal passes and someone is successful in convincing Mr. Beast to feature the Nouns in the most watched show on the internet while hopefully giving a lot of money away to good causes it will have a **Total Cost of 500 Eth.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHY MR. BEAST?**\nHe is the most watched person on the internet (with over 100m subscribers and up to 300m views on his videos), so I think Nouns featuring on his show would bring awareness to Nouns, NFTs, DAOs and Ethereum to millions. In doing so, it will allow people to see the great creative initiatives that Nouns are working on and have funded (e.g.[73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73))  as well as charities it has supported (e.g. [104](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104) ,[42](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42) ). On top of this I would hope it will showcase the ability of a decentralised network of people to raise funds and successfully deploy those funds in innovative ways that leverages its community to make big things happen!\n\nMr. Beast already has a good awareness of crypto and he has a history of giving to charity at a large scale too so hopefully he will be able to bring awareness to all of this in a thoughtful, considered, and fun way.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **A $250k REWARD … THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY!?**\nI can imagine some Nouners balking at the $250k prize being paid to whoever can convince Mr. Beast to take on this challenge, which is understandable.\n\nMy goal is to create value for the DAO and while one could argue that people will take on this challenge for a smaller amount – we just don’t know if it would be _as_ effective and ultimately it will always be a guess as to what the _right_ figure is.\n\nThe goal is to mobilise 99.9% of the internet and get them interested in making this happen through the incentive of a big reward. And while no one can be certain of the exact figure that would be most effective, what I _do_ know is that $250k has a high chance of success. It will advertise itself by getting people talking about it and it will massively increase the chances of the challenge being accepted. I believe we would rather potentially pay more to increase the chances of success.\n\nWhile it is a lot of money, I think it presents extremely good value. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If no one can make it happen, nothing gets paid out and the price is zero. But if someone does make it happen, a $750k price to have the Nouns featured on the most watched show on the internet will provide great value.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHAT DO I GET FROM THIS?**\nNothing\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Terms and Conditions**\n*   Transfer will be made to the prize winner after the video has aired on YouTube.\n*   Mr. Beast cannot refer himself as the person to win the prize.\n*   If Mr. Beast decides to do the show but does not (or can not) identify the person or message that convinced him to take it on - the $250k will be put into a prop house round where $50k will be awarded to 5 charities as voted on by Nouners.\n*   The $500k (340 Eth) will be transferred from the multisig to Mr. Beast upon written agreement between the parties.\n*   For the interest of transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest: I am not Mr. Beast nor do I have any affiliation with him in any way. If (somehow) it is me or this proposal that convinces him to do the challenge or to do it for charity, I will pledge the prize fund to charity and no Nounder will be eligible to win this prize.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Funds**\nIf the proposal passes, Eth to the equivalent of $750k will be converted to USDC to fund the challenge and any excess will be returned to the treasury. \n\nThe funds will remain in the multisig until either the challenge is accepted or converted back to Eth and returned to the treasury after 9 months if the challenge is not accepted.\n\nThe funds will be held in a 2 / 3 Multisig with the signatures being:\n\n*   Hindsight - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/0xhindsight.eth)\n*   Jarmen - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n*   Sam Ellis - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)","endBlock":"15962193","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"7","id":"168","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321dad0a0bf9a148","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1668071351","calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000051c7d7c47e440d937208bd987140d6db6b1e4051"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x6f3e6272a167e8accb32072d08e0957f9c79223d"],"values":["0"],"totalSupply":"506","startBlock":"15953029","signatures":["_setImplementation(address)"],"quorumVotes":"50","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15938629","createdTransactionHash":"0xe79e8ed55d5f6e918699a05b9971c8310c4a17e723887505cabedf64b50ef4bf","description":"# Nouns DAO V2.1 Minor Fix\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with a single minor improvement:\n\n**Vote with Gas Refund**: change refund destination such that multisig voter that pays for gas get refunded, rather than sending the refund to the multisig contract. \n\nTechnically, this change involves refunding `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`.\n\nExact changes can be seen here: https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/604\n\nBecause this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process.

Scope for these contributions is considered open-ended, and will be defined on a monthly cadence with the input of the Nounders & the community. This proposal seeks to bring on three individuals with deep interest in the Nouns ecosystem, and a proven track record of delivering value on short timelines & at an early stage.\n\n### Context\n\nAs part of their original contributions, the Nounders built [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf), home to daily Noun auctions, governance, an exploratory playground, and details of the project and its motivations. Given the rapid increase in interest and usage of the Nouns products, we propose bringing on world-class design & engineering resourcing to help iterate on the future of [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf).\n\nMany Nounders remain involved in varying capacities in day-to-day community affairs, but the demands of the role are non-trivial and [critical to the success of any DAO](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1450990370528141315?s=20). We propose bringing on a talented community lead who will help strengthen the sense of shared purpose within the Nouns community.\n\n### Scope\n\nScope for these contributors will be defined on an on-going basis with input from Nounders, Noun owners, and the greater Nouns community. Contributors will be expected to communicate their deliverables & timelines in a public manner at least once per month. \n\nFor the design & engineering roles, the initial set of scope includes maintenance and improvements to [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf). For the community role, contributions include (but are not limited to) scheduling & leading community calls, internal & external communications, Discord management, and onboarding of new DAO members.\n\n### Expectations\n\nContributors are responsible for documenting and communicating their decisions & output. Updates should be shared early and often, encouraging Nounders and community members to provide input given the shared vision for the Nouns ecosystem. Contributors are expected to be responsive, but are free to define the working style which lends itself to the best outcomes. The commitments will last for **3 months**, or 90 days, after which point this proposal will be resubmitted to extend the working relationship.\n\n### Contributors\n\nInformation on the contributors is available in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/898682149585162270/907593435417038889) in #private on the Nouns Discord.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe believe that the NounsDAO could fund this proposal, decreasing the burden of project maintenance on the Nounders and increasing the lifespan of product & community development for the community. For this initial trial, compensation will be paid out via streaming payments on Sablier. Each contributor will be paid `~5.9 ETH` per month, for approximately three months, or `~17.69 ETH` over 91 days. In the case of poor performance, the `cancelStream` method may be invoked, returning funds to an escrow and the contributor(s) pro-rata based on time elapsed.\n\nThe proposal also includes a transfer of `0.22 ETH` to [0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e) as reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal.","endBlock":"13655613","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"46","id":"17","maxQuorumVotesBPS":0,"minQuorumVotesBPS":0,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"22","delegatedVotesRaw":"22","id":"0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":13}},{"createdTimestamp":"1668377903","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x5e967b7afbbcde04511f0634cbea0811ac95a974"],"values":["195000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"510","startBlock":"15978444","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"76","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"19","againstVotes":"67","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15964044","createdTransactionHash":"0x7ee11e998a5c0c2e78d37a5b4d3c0cc6f3cedd34c409584b0665aa81694ceb15","description":"# Nouns Name Service Expansion  ⌐◨-◨\n\n**TL;DR After being funded for [2ETH by Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/round-2/63) 7 months ago, we have built an entire, functioning naming service called Nouns Name Service (NNS, built on the .⌐◨-◨ domain.) We are now asking the DAO to fund us to bring Nouns Name Service to the next level.**\n\nThe Nouns Name Service (nns.xyz) is a naming system that aims to empower communities and spread the nounish culture.\n\nThe main Top Level Domain of the Nouns Name Service is the .⌐◨-◨ .\n\nJust as a .eth is resolved in yourname.eth, having a .⌐◨-◨  will allow you to attach the Nouns DAO noggles to your on-chain identity and be resolved as yourname.⌐◨-◨ .\n\n[![nns-screen.png](https://i.postimg.cc/7YhPfPhN/nns-screen.png)](https://postimg.cc/crqGzSQK)\n[*nns.xyz*](https://nns.xyz)\n\n## Background\nThe Nouns Name Service (NNS) received 2 ETH in Prop House – Round 2 (April 2022) as trial funding to prove out the concept and build our reputation as trustworthy builders in the ecosystem.\n \nAfter 4 months of work we delivered the first version of the NNS (nns.xyz) and in the first month post-launch, we have already created a powerful ecosystem of partners which allowed the NNS to be natively resolved across the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n[![Xva8Rxz7.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MZCxK0kz/Xva8Rxz7.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/6TfFMv5P)\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal will allow the NNS to build the infrastructure required to start phase 2 of our strategy: Expansion.\n\nIn particular, these are the main goals of this phase, which will be completed over a 5 months period:\n\n* Integrate the NNS into new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouniverse.\n* Integration of an additional .nouns TLD that will help overcome .⌐◨-◨ copy-paste problems on external apps making its applications more flexible and effective.\n* Create a DAO powered by Nouns Builder to empower the NNS Squad, our community of people who got their .⌐◨-◨, with an experimental treasury to reward members and finance new initiatives.\n* Build new utility tools around the NNS. The first in the pipeline is a nounish NNS version of EtherScan. \n* Launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation in and outside the Nouniverse through a new experiment of community reward and participation.\n* Create a full documentation for end-users and developers expanding the ways in which they can integrate the NNS in their projects.\n* Start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3.\n\n**Requesting** funding of 195 ETH to execute our Expansion Phase.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility exposure of any kind.\n\n[![NNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/yd7g5qPr/NNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SXtx2vHW)\n\n## How the NNS started\nThe idea of the NNS originated from a question:\n \n*“Is there a way to transform a meme icon into a fully functional domain, where its utility grows proportionally to the meme adoption?”*\n \nDuring the first months of work, this idea evolved from its very first draft on Prop House, letting the NNS become a possible solution to several interesting scenarios:\n \n* In an ecosystem based on CC0 like the Nouniverse, with a lot of new communities and sub-DAOs, the .⌐◨-◨ could become a universal tool for companies and creators to interact with the entire ecosystem at once.\n***How so?***\nThe power of a CC0 ecosystem is the proliferation of a main idea in many sub-projects and communities. In the Nouniverse, that idea is represented by the ⌐◨-◨ meme. The noggles appear in every nounish community, but at the same time they are part of different NFTs and collections. At the moment, there isn’t a token that can unify the Nouns ecosystem at an infrastructural level. The .⌐◨-◨ can fill this gap, allowing companies and creators to reach the whole ecosystem by simply integrating the NNS into their token-gated experiences and initiatives.\n\n* The more the NNS is integrated on new apps and marketplaces across the world, the more the .⌐◨-◨  will help spread the nounish culture at an exponential level.\n***How so?***\nThe NNS serves as an on-chain identity badge for all the people who share the nounish culture. Having your .⌐◨-◨  attached to your web3 identity makes it clear that you belong to the “nounish internet society”. The more the NNS will expand, the more the Nouns proliferation will reach places that wouldn’t even have been considered before.\n\n* In a market dominated by 2 titan projects and few TLDs, the NNS could become the first experiment of a collaborative naming system on ETH. This would allow other communities to join the NNS and create their own TLD on top of the NNS, making the whole protocol stronger and more widely adopted, and offering the new communities the advantage of having their TLD natively resolved across the NNS network from day 1. \n***How so?***\nOnce the Nouns Name Service is globally recognised by important apps in the space, it could open its network to other communities as well. This way, communities will not only get their customized TLD (that’s nothing new), but this will be able to be natively resolved everywhere from the very beginning. This will literally onboard in the Nouniverse and in Nouns DAO whole communities made by end-users and talented builders, constantly bringing new ideas and improving engagement thanks to a proven system of funding based on Prop House, Small Grants and all the other nounish DAOs.\n\n**In a nutshell,** for a community joining the NNS would mean not only having a naming infrastructure, but also being able to build and nurture important relationships in the Nouniverse that will push new ideas and collaborations with the entire ecosystem.\n\nThese applications, which at the moment represent our focus, will offer Nouns and the Nouniverse an important value in terms of proliferation, new users in existing nounish platforms and the attraction of new builders.\n\nAnd we are confident this is just the beginning of many other applications for the NNS.\n\n[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/CKSxMGqR/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bZVh32LP)\n\n## Roadmap (The 3 Phases)\nBuilding this kind of Naming System is a big task. Which is why we split our development in 3 Phases. After the first one is completed, the NNS will be able to move to the next one, and so on.\n\n### PHASE 1: Core Ecosystem and Community\nThe power of any protocol lies in its network.\nThat’s why our top priority since launch has always been to build a strong core ecosystem from which we can expand.\n\nWhile new naming systems often rely on external plugins to resolve their names, the NNS aims to create a network where every NNS name is natively resolved without any additional action by the users.\n \nAt the time of writing, the NNS has been supported by all the major nounish projects, officially connecting the Nouniverse. \n\n[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNcXyNvt/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/RNVCd99c)\n \n**ENS reservation period and stats:** \n\nDuring the first 60 days after launch NNS names could only be claimed by their correspondent .eth.\n \nWhile this impacted the NNS growth in the very short term, it also allowed the early adopters to have full control of their identities, thus focusing more on identity than speculation.\n\nThe ENS reservation ended on 19 October 2022 with the following results:\n\n* 355 names claimed\n* 252 unique owners\n \nAs you’re reading this, after 4 months of development and 2 months of Reservation Period, Phase 1 is officially completed.\n\nAt this time, 2 weeks after the end of the Reservation Period, a total of 526 .⌐◨-◨  names have been registered from 311 unique owners.\n\n[![nns-launch-artwork.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KvH4WgjG/nns-launch-artwork.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt7bzk7J)\n\n### PHASE 2: Expansion and Nounish Club\n\nPhase 2 will start the real proliferation of the NNS.\n\nAs mentioned in the TL;DR, the Expansion phase will have several goals, starting from the integration of the NNS in new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouns ecosystem, also solving the .⌐◨-◨ current copy-paste issue. \n\nPart of the Expansion will also be the building of an NNS Scan, which you can picture like an NNS version of EtherScan. We will also create a new and more complete website, where end-users and developers will be able to access a full documentation so that they can find new ways to integrate the NNS in their projects. \n\nThe NNS Squad will also have access to an experimental Treasury which will be used to reward active members and finance new missions.\n\nFinally, and what we believe is the most exciting part of this Phase, we will launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation through an experimental form of community reward and participation. \n\nAt the end of these developments, we will start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3. \n\n### The Nounish Club \n\nThe Nounish Club is an experiment made to reward nouners, nounish projects and communities outside the Nouniverse through new forms of community participation.\n \nThe idea is to allocate to this initiative all the numbers from 0 to 9999.⌐◨-◨, making them a new coveted asset to stimulate NNS proliferation and inspire new community ideas.\n\nHowever, these numbers won't be available to be bought from the NNS.\n\nThey will only be earnable by taking active part in .⌐◨-◨ proliferation and in special initiatives, and they will be entirely distributed for free through what we like to call a “Proof of Proliferation” process. \n\nThe Nounish Club will be an exclusive group inside the NNS, completely in the hands of the Nouniverse.\n \nEvery nounish project will be able to add a special benefit to the club, such as discounts, NFTs, voting power, early accesses and more. They will also be able to ask the NNS to get a specific allocation of numbers to be shared among their communities or to be used as assets to keep in their treasury.\n \nThe more benefits will be added, the more the access to the Nounish Club will be valued.\n\nHere are some key points of how this would work:\n\n* The NNS will allocate an initial amount of numbers to the NNS Squad DAO created through Nouns Builder. This will add an additional asset to the treasury that will be managed according to DAO voting.\n* For the first 6 months, the numbers from 0 to 669 will be reserved for Nouners. Every existing nouner, as well as new ones, can request their specific numbers offering their help to proliferate the Nouns Name Service or to add benefits to make the Nounish Club more valuable. \n* Specific numbers would be used to invite new strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\n* Nounish DAOs and projects would be able to request a certain allocation of numbers for proliferation initiatives. This will make the distribution of the Nounish Club more and more decentralized.\n* If the experimental allocation to the NNS Squad DAO is successful, the NNS will gradually allocate a bigger amount of numbers to the DAO over time. \n\nThe Nounish Club benefits will be grouped on a url like nounishclub.wtf and new proposals about ideas, benefits and allocations can be managed through the NNS Squad DAO and discussed on the NNS Discord.\n\nThe Nounish Club will also use Prophouse as another important tool to generate and reward new ideas.\n\n#### Why the Nounish Club?\n\nWe are exploring what the NNS can become through a continuous loop of never-tried before experiments and feedback. The Nounish Club is one of them.\n\nThe reason we are excited about the Nounish Club is that we believe it can be an interesting experiment which, if successful, will be able to create a massive value for every community in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThis value can be seen as:\n\n* **Building value:** It will be a further incentive for nounish communities to build cool things for the NNS and the Nounish Club.\n* **Proliferation value:** It will generate a further proliferation of the .⌐◨-◨  and can be used to onboard strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\n* **Economic value:** The more the NNS and the Nounish Club will grow, the more every name of the Club will be valuable (incentivizing more building around it).\n\n[![NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/90rG85XH/NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hQRzvY72)\n\n### PHASE 3: Protocol\n\nOnce the NNS is supported by the major platforms in the space and successfully completes all the other tasks, it will be ready to open the protocol to other communities.\n \nThis upgrade will allow other great projects to build their TLD on top of the Nouns Name Service.\n \nThis will strengthen the relationship between the Nouniverse and worldwide communities working together for the proliferation of the Nouns Name Service.\n \nDwelling on the developments of Phase 3 is not the focus of this proposal, which aims to focus on the Expansion and Phase 2. However, our ultimate mission is making Nouns the center of a naming revolution that will attract not only end users, but also companies and other big projects.\n \nSome aspects of Phase 3 are still being brainstormed and we can’t wait to share more details with the community when they’ll be ready.\n\n## FUNDS\n\n### Personal context for full transparency from Dom (@dotnouns)\n\nBesides the 2 ETH received from Prop House in April, all the NNS development was bootstrapped.\n\nAs a founder and a true believer in the NNS, since the end of May I decided to commit 90% of my time on the project, gradually reducing the personal clients I was following in my day job.\n \nIf this can seem a hazard to many, burning the bridges that could act as a way out allowed the project to be laser focused on execution and allowed the NNS to become what it is today.\n \nThe goal of this proposal is helping the NNS to build a starting fund that will push the development and the proliferation with the same laser focus that has characterized Phase 1.\n\n### The request in a nutshell\n\nWe are requesting 195 ETH to scale the NNS, fully complete Phase 2 and begin experiments for Phase 3 as well.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility of any kind.\n\n### How the funds will be used\n\nThe funding from this proposal will serve to develop the following areas, which will be crucial for the long-term success:\n \n·  \t**Expand the team** and hire top professionals for specific tasks or projects. In particular, main focus will be given to external integrations and community building.\n·  \t**Design a website** that will offer more support to end users and developers. This will include an extensive tech documentation and FAQ section.\n·  \t**Create a DAO for the NNS Squad through Nouns Builder.** The DAO treasury will be used to coordinate proliferation actions among members and to manage the allocation of numbers for the Nounish Club.\n·  \t**Create an NNS House on Prop House** focused on building new products for the NNS ecosystem, the Nounish Club and developing new integrations with important partners.\n·  \t**Push proliferation** in and outside the Nouns ecosystem through the Nounish Club.\n·  \t**Add a new .nouns TLD** that will help overcome .⌐◨-◨ copy-paste problems on external apps, thus making its applications more flexible and effective. \n\n### Thoughts about the .⌐◨-◨  copy-paste “issue”\n\nOne frequent objection about the .⌐◨-◨  is that noggles are not easy to type on the keyboard. This is indisputably true.\n\nThe .⌐◨-◨  is first of all an identity badge of the Nouniverse. That’s why it’s natively resolved on all the nounish platforms without any effort or action by the user.\n\nEven if every tool built around the NNS would make writing the .⌐◨-◨ easy as a click, to expand the applications of the Nouns Name Service we are also exploring the creation of a .nouns TLD.\nThis domain would ease the integration of the NNS in several apps (especially wallets) and would unlock interesting additional applications.\n\nIn the future, NNS users would be able to connect all their NNS names to this core extension and from their dashboard they could decide how they want to appear in their favorite communities.\n\nThis development is still in brainstorming mode, but we wanted to share it to give some context about our initial focus and what we’re going to work on next.\n\n### Milestones and funding release\n\nIn an effort to show our commitment and laser focus in the NNS mission, we decided to divide the funding allocation in 2 tranches.\n\nThe first 97.5 ETH will be unlocked upfront and will cover the first 3 months.\nIn particular, during this period we will: \n\n* Launch and proliferate the Nounish Club project and its DAO\n* Release the new website with a full documentation\n* Complete the first new integrations with projects outside the Nouns ecosystem\n* Start the first experiments with the .nouns extension. (If everything works smoothly we will be able to release it during the first 3 months, otherwise it will be launched in month 4.)\n\nThe list only refers to the goals highlighted in this proposal and doesn't include actions that will be part of the ordinary proliferation strategy of the NNS, such as community initiatives, viral actions and collabs with other projects in and outside the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nAt the end of the first 3 months, these milestones will be checked and verified by nouns community members Toady Hawk and Benbodhi.\n\nIf this first Milestone Check is successful, the second and last part of the funding will be released.\n\n### Multisig Wallet\n\nFunds will be managed through a Gnosis multisig wallet (2/3) with the following trusted signers:\n\n* [Dotnouns](https://twitter.com/dotnouns) (NNS)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Proposal Sponsor and Milestones Checker)\n* [Benbodhi](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/benbodhi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Milestone Checker)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is what the Nouns Name Service is right now, and what it could become.\n\nWe realize it’s an ambitious vision, and that there might be challenges and many things we didn’t predict, as for every venture in unexplored waters. \n\nHowever, ever since the beginning, we’ve tried to earn the community’s trust. We are now fully committing ourselves to something that could be extremely beneficial for the Nouns ecosystem in the long term.\n\n**If you believe in this project, we ask you to consider supporting this proposal, so that we can together build the future of the Nouns Name Service!**\n\n","endBlock":"16014444","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"91","id":"170","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x5d802e2fe48392c104ce0401c7eca8a4456f1f16","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1668458303","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xf0fcb01e1b130a9b7aed2d798a5877648d3ed517"],"values":["126000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"510","startBlock":"15985114","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"52","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"19","againstVotes":"2","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15970714","createdTransactionHash":"0xadd05fe7e772f85a6feb48c0adaa64734cf828f6b1718d8c63c5abb25b31ed20","description":"# DCS Pod\n\n## tl;dr ##\nDCS is a pod that focuses on bridging the gap between existing off-chain funding options and larger on-chain props. Focused primarily on the sectors of software, arts and IRL with a funding range between 8-25Ξ, our goal is to help builders with a track record scale up within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n## Overview ##\n\nThere currently exists a large gap within the current Nouns funding landscape that creates challenges for Nounish builders in the ecosystem. \n\nOn the lower end of the spectrum, there are many options for builders to seek funding for <10Ξ, between NSFW, Prop House, and a number of subDAO efforts (Gnars, SharkDAO, Lil Nouns, etc). On the higher end, there is virtually no limit as we have seen on-chain props go to $1M and beyond.\n\nHowever, in between these two points there is a gap that continues to grow as we see NSFW, Prop House, and subDAOs prefering to run more experiments with smaller amounts, all the while prominent Nouners are increasingly calling for the DAO to scale upward and not consider on-chain props lower than 20Ξ.\n\nThis places builders in a tough spot where they must figure out how to take their concept from point A to point B to achieve escape velocity. This issue is further exacerbated by the closure of the official Nouns Discord server, which will make it harder for the DAO to reach consensus on on-chain props as a governing body.\n\nDCS will focus on working with these builders who have \"graduated\" from one of the off-chain funding programs and provide them with bridge funding and guidance as they work towards the goal of passing a larger scale on-chain prop with the broader DAO base.\n\nSaid a different way, we help builders **Do Cool Sh*t**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pMkWTM2.png)\n\n## Pod Details ##\n\nDCS pod members will leverage their Nounish network and experience to guide and work with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO. DCS will act as a working group to ensure our funded builders are provided more than just capital but an active group to collaborate with and build alongside.\n\n**The pod plays a key role in four ways:**\n\n- Creates a stepping stone for off-chain \"graduates\" on their journey to larger on-chain props, both in terms of financial support and guidance in refining their project\n- Provides accountability and additional data points for the broader DAO to consider when the resulting props go on-chain\n- Emphasizes a transparent decision making framework that is data-driven and scalable\n- Actively works with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO by being a source of active support and guidance helping them move through the roadblocks and challenges they face\n\n**What areas will the pod focus on?**\n\nDCS will focus on key areas where we feel we can provide the most value and help ideas scale quickly. Given the subject matter expertise and experience of pod members, the following areas are our initial focus: \n\n- **Software** - dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, gaming\n- **Arts & Content** - artists, musicians, video and content creators\n- **IRL** - local/regional activations, events, and other on-the-ground efforts\n\n\n**How will the group operate?**\n\n- Props (sourced from off-chain funding programs) will be be submitted to the pod online\n- Prop will be discussed on weekly DCS calls\n- Prop will be voted on in the DCS Discord\n\nWe will work with the operators of the various off-chain funding program to raise visibility for DCS as a \"next step\" for graduates. We will use Prop House and/or [AddressBoard](https://www.addressform.io/) to receive formal funding requests, so we can ensure proper data collection throughout the process for the DAO.\n\nThe pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been submitted since the last meeting and to discuss additional pipeline developments. These calls will be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and elevate the quality of props that get funded. Emphasis will be placed on data-driven processes to ensure greater builder accountability and proper measurement of ROI back to the DAO.\n\nAfter discussion, pod members will decide which props will be funded by voting on a dedicated Discord channel (or via Prop House platform).\n\nPod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod). Pod members will be rotated every 3-6 months in order to spread knowledge, boost decentralization and to ensure the pod is not overly reliant on any single member. A maximum of 2 pod members will be substituted at a time, not to create disruption in the work flow. One pod member will be elected secretary by the pod, and this person will take care of administrative tasks including providing a summary of the meeting in writing, which will be available to the public through the DCS discord.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require 3 of 5 members to sign.\n\nBudget: 126Ξ\nBreakdown:\n* Props: 75Ξ\n* Admin: 51Ξ\n    * Target prop funding: ranging from ~9x8Ξ - 3x25Ξ projects\n    * 5 pod members\n        * Core member: 3Ξ per month\n        * Secretary: add'l 2Ξ per month\n\nFor context, this is 0,4% of our treasury. We are aiming to propose a low-risk/high-reward pod.\n\n## Pod Members ##\n\n1. **[B](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/beautyandthepunk.eth), yours truly.** \n\n    **Twitter:** @beautyandpunk \n    **Discord:** thebeautyandthepunk#8285\n    **Specialty Areas:** Art, esports, sports, extreme sports, onboarding, science, underrepresented communities\n    \n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n\n    **Nouns**\n    Prop 41: Nouns 3D-printed fashion collection by DANIT: milestones 3+4\n    Prop 82: Sell Noun #253 to Lil Nouns DAO\n    Prop 95: Nouns @ Art Basel (Basel, Switzerland)\n    Prop 98: NOUNS IN RIO - Nouns to be a part of the 1st Brazilian international NFT exhibition\n    Prop 118: NounsDAO Brazil\n    Prop 119: Nouns Esports Pod\n\n    **Lil Nouns**\n    Prop 30: Lil Sisters Fund\n    2 rounds of 5 x 1ETH props through Lil Sisters.\n\n    **Prop House**\n    100 Nounish hoodies for homeless people\n    20 Twitter covers for 20 nouns projects\n    Nouns OS as an entire Operating System Nouns-Themed for All Things Nouns\n    Nounified Skate Park @ RIO\n    Nounifying Brazil and Web3 Workshops in communities of Rio de Janeiro\n    Lil Noun sponsorship to AWEN 7-a-side women's soccer team\n    Rap Battle by Nouns\n    Nouns School Web3 Platform\n    Nouns Waves - Sunny Pires Sponsorship\n    Valorant Brazilian Women's Team\n    Brazilian influencer soy_taki\n    FestiNouns Awen 2022\n    Nounish Coloring Booklet for Children\n    Finance children in need at TPM, a Brazilian NGO from Nuala Costa, an LGBTQIAP+ black surfer\n\n2. **[Oni](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/apenoun.eth)** \n\n    **Twitter:** @apenoun\n    **Discord:** Oni#1111\n    **Specialty Areas:** Gaming, tech, art, fashion, design, charity, governance\n    \n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    Prop 40: Nouns Skate Decks for kids in need\n    Prop 53: Calladita Film Funding\n    Prop 97: Nouns Baked Beans\n    Prop 119: Nouns Esports Pod Member\n    Prop 132: Nouns x Dopamine Merch\n\n    **IRL Activations:**\n    Nouns @ Annual Coin Center Dinner\n    Nouns x TSP NFT NYC Go Skateboarding Day event\n    Nouns x TSP Long Beach Skateboard Giveaway \n\n3. **[EOJ](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8), Noun 354 & 227, former Growth at Ledger.**\n\n    **Twitter:** @EojJim \n    **Discord:** Eoj#7391\n    **Specialty Areas:** Art, Crypto, {DeFi/NFT}  Fashion, Investing\n\n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    -Prop 126: Nouns x John Hamon \n    -Prop due diligence with builders to hash out and iterate on prop ideas such as Prop 116: Comic Book Release and Prop 135: Xanadu\n    -Working with NFT Paris organizers to assemble a nounish activation in 2023 (discovery phase)\n    -Active contributor in Nouner weekly calls \n\n\n4. **[Sam Ellis](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)** \n\n    **Twitter:** @manofmissle, \n    **Discord:** samellis ⌐◨-◨#4764\n    **Specialty Areas:** Gaming, art and design, animation, comics, conventions/irl events, charity, onboarding\n    \n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    Participated in the first days of testing nouns on Rinkeby\n    Active Nouncil member that regularly participates in voting\n    Active participant and on the organizing committee for The Noun Square\n    Participant in the funded Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)\n    Co-developed Composables    \n    Co-developed YOLO Nouns\n    Co-developed Nouns Auction Tracker\n    Co-developed Nounish Labs & 1/2 owner of Noun 455\n    Introduced Samsung to Nouns which lead to their video in Times Square and 837X DCL experience.\n    \n5. **[Juan](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/juanx.eth)** \n\n    **Twitter:** @juanhernanx \n    **Discord:** Juan ⌐◨-◨#2492\n    **Specialty Areas:** Software, dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, business, finance\n\n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    Nounish Labs: Owner of Noun 455\n    Co-developed Composables\n    Co-developed YOLO Nouns\n    Co-developed Nouns Auction Tracker\n    Prop House: Crowdsourcing Ideas round winner\n    Prop House Challenge: Composables\n    Prop House: Nounish Hackathon\n    Active Nouncil member    \n    \n\n\n---\n\n\nIf at the end of the 3-month period not enough good props were found and funded, the funds will be returned to the Nouns DAO treasury.

As soon as the rest of the USDC is available, it is sent to the recipient's wallet, no user intervention needed. We expect this to take a few days at most, depending on the total amount.\n\nTokenBuyer allows anyone to swap USDC for the ETH it holds. It uses Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed to set the price.\n\nWhenever a proposal requests USDC from the DAO, it will also include a transaction to top up TokenBuyer with additional ETH, proportional to the USDC amount requested.\n\n(*This \"automatic top-off\" is part of nouns.wtf; other governance clients can choose whether they implement this behavior*)\n\n### Example:\n* Builder A creates a proposal that requests 100,000 USDC\n* 2 actions will be added to the proposal:\n    1. Send 100K USDC from the TokenBuyer to Builder A\n    2. Send $150K worth of ETH to TokenBuyer to swap for USDC\n       * The extra $50K (50% buffer) is added in case ETH price goes down\n       * If TokenBuyer already holds ETH, then it will be sent less ETH accordingly\n* When the proposal executes:\n    1. 100K USDC it sent to Builder A\n        * If TokenBuyer has less than 100K USDC on hand, a debt will be registered towards Builder A\n    3. TokenBuyer will swap ETH for 100K USDC\n    4. Any remaining USDC debt to Builder A is paid as soon as it is swapped\n\n### UI preview\n\nThis is a preview of a new proposal creation flow for nouns.wtf developed by Brian.\nIt will go live once it's possible to request USDC.\n\n![proposal_ui_1](https://i.imgur.com/cOqFO3V.png)\n![proposal_ui_2](https://i.imgur.com/vZNqCJ7.png)\n\n### Parameters\n\n* `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`: amount of USDC to hold \"on hand\". Currently set to $500,000.\n* `botDiscountBPs`: a price discount to incentivize anyone (probably bots) to swap USDC for ETH. Currently set to 10 bps (0.1%).\n\n### Admin access\n* The tech pod & the DAO have an \"operator\" privilege with permissions to:\n    * Modify `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`, allowed range is: 0 - $1M\n    * Modify `botDiscountBPs`, allowed range is: 0-150 (0-1.5%)\n    * Pause TokenBuyer swaps\n    * Withdraw ETH from TokenBuyer and send it to the DAO\n    * Change the operator\n* Only the DAO has the ability to:\n    * Send USDC\n    * Change the allowed ranges for `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` and `botDiscountBPs`\n\n### Arbitrage bot\n* A reference bot has been developed and [open-sourced](https://github.com/solimander/eth-buyer-arbitrage-bot) by solimander. We encourage anyone to run their own bot or improve on the code\n* The tech pod will be running the reference bot at the beginning to bootstrap the system\n* Anyone can perform swaps against TokenBuyer. If we see low activity, we will increase the `botDiscountBPs` parameters to increase the incentive (e.g. if gas prices become high).\n\n## Auditing and Testing\n\n* The smart contracts were audited by yAcademy. [Audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/blob/166ec30ecd5dada8e17b55317ce3823d4c36b35f/audit/yAcademy_NounsDAO_TokenBuyer_review.pdf)\n    * No \"critical\" issues were found\n    * 1 \"high\" and 1 \"medium\" issues were found. The \"high\" issue was fixed, and the \"medium\" issue was acknowledged as not being an issue for us.\n* Prior to this proposal a few rounds of funding and spending using Token Buyer were done on mainnet\n\n\n## Funding\n* Assuming `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` is set to $500K, we would want to fund TokenBuyer with enough ETH to swap for $500K. We suggested adding an extra 50% to account for price changes. At current ETH prices this 750,000 / 1200 = 625 ETH\n* The initial ETH amount will be sent to the tech pod multisig\n* The tech pod will deploy it into TokenBuyer in chunks while monitoring that it performs correctly\n\n---\n\nIncluded Transactions:\n\n* Send 625 ETH to: `0x79095391743e0f017A16c388De6a6a3f175a5cD5` (Tech Pod Multisig)","endBlock":"16034477","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"194","id":"172","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"3","delegatedVotesRaw":"3","id":"0xe26d78c6bff297bbc2da3f80fea9a42028a4260f","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1668709271","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xac2671baaa44b79ca1fb006750c684e5349d721b"],"values":["154000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"514","startBlock":"16005898","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"74","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"23","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"15991498","createdTransactionHash":"0x739a5b224f55d4c531505ee1718a9817125641113aa325553ddd32feb7221fc2","description":"# Sail Nouns in the New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2023\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PHkFAtJ.jpg)\n\n### TL;DR\n - Fleet of seven J/24 sailboats with Nounish sails and one bigger sailboat\n - Photo and video opportunities in front of Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty\n - 100 guests onboard will actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails \n - Post-event meetup at the Manhattan Yacht Club’s clubhouse\n\n# Description\n\n### Why Sailing?\nI ([fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)) have been sailing for 11 years and recently combined my passion for sailing and love of Nouns by organizing a regatta through Seoul (funded by [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102)). Sailing is one of the most prestigious sports and often gets attention of the media, guests, and residents. It's enjoyable to participate in, to watch live, and creates beautiful images and video to share.\n\n\n### Nouns in the New York Harbor\nNFT.NYC is only four months away. Most likely NFT and web3 projects are going to run the same promotions with posters and billboards. *Why not make something different?*\n\nFollowing the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 9th in New York with help of Manhattan Yacht Club. The NFT.NYC sailing event is going to be order of magnitute larger to match the gravity of the legendary New York.\n\n\nI will put together a fleet of seven J/24 sailboats and one bigger sailboat in New York bay with Nounish sails. We are going to invite Nounish people and sail together from New Jersey to Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWe'll be using J/24 sailboats for this event because it is the world's most popular one-design keelboat. It is a classic Porsche of sailing and respected by all sailors. It is easy to sail and looks beautiful when you get up the Nounish spinnakers.\n\n\n### Interactive Community Building\nThe plan is to make teams of 3 experienced sailors and 3-4 guests for each boat. The guests will be able to actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails. We are going to use one bigger boat to accomodate all guests and swap guests on boats near the Statue Of Liberty so all the guests can get full experience. 100 people will be invited, with priority to for the Nouns community. 20 invitations will be sent to special NFT.NYC attendees (media, artists, etc.) \n\nIt is going to be unforgettable experience. Later, we can gather together at Manhattan Yacht Club's clubhouse and share a few beers.\n\nLet's enjoy early spring sailing in NYC together and use this unique opportunity as a team building and proliferating event. A lot of New Yorkers and visitors are going to see Nouns logos during NFT.NYC and posted on social networks.\n\n### Documentation\nAll events/locations before and during the event will be documented and all media will be regularly shared with the [nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish) team and posted on social networks.\n\n----\n# Details\n\n### Event map\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysZx8iI.png)\n\n### Nouns branded sail designs\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S7SfqsE.jpg)\n\nBased on sail inventory availabe at Manhattan Yacht Club, it would be best to buy both mainsail and spinnaker sails. The available at manhattan yacht club sails have mount gay rum logos and wouldn't look good during our photo ops.\n\nDiscussions on sail designs and upcomming events will be posted on twitter and nounish discord.\n\nAfter NFT.NYC, the sails will be shipped and stored in my yacht club, in korea for possible future Nounish events.\n\nThere are four different design options availbe\n1) same color fabric, red noggles\n2) same color fabric, different color noggles\n3) different color fabrick, red noggles\n4) different color fabric, different color noggles\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Jiz8Rn0.png)\n\nIMO most of the beautiful thing about nouns community is collective hacking, designing, and thinking. I would like to get feedback from community to find best sail designs. \n\n\n----\n# Budget\n### Nouns NFT.NYC sailing photo op & team building\nWe going to invite as many people as possible, starting with Nounish folks. The event would be a best way to proliferate Nouns and organize a team building event for Nounish people.\n- **$24,000** Chartering fees for 7+ boats at Manhattan Yacht Club\n    - I received quote of $3,800 per boat for a general public\n    - The price might go down after I send an official request from my yacht club\n- **$35,000** Nouns sails inventory for 7+ boats\n    - (branded spinnakers and mainsails)\n    - I wil keep all the sails safe for future possible events. For example, NFT.NYC sailing event in 2024!\n- **$10,000** Small travel grants for sailing teams comming from Seattle, San Francisco, Texas, Michigan, Maryland.\n    - We need experienced crew to operate sailboats.\n    - The plan is to make teams of 3 pro sailors and 3-4 guests per one boat\n- **$15,000** Safety and media motor boats etc\n    - It is very important to have a couple motor boats available for media or in the case of emergency\n- **$5,000** The big boat is going to accomodate more guests. Later, on the way back from the Statue Of Liberty, we aregoing to swap guests and give more people chance to experience J/24 sailing.\n    - NFT.NYC is a big event and we might want to invite a lot of interesting people to the Nouns sailing event\n    - Also, some parts of New York bay is no fly zone for drones so it would be best to put a few photographers on a bigger boat\n- **$15,000** photo/video team\n- **$5,000** Nouns branded t-shirts and caps to look like a true team (120 pcs)\n- **$5,000** BBQ, beers, and rum for after party at Manhattan Yacht Club\n- **$21,000** expenses for operations team including me; $7k per person (I will need at least two reliable people with sailing experience with me to organize 7+ sailboats, photo ops, coordinate everyone etc; getting ready venue and boats 2 days before the event; 2 days cleaning boats and packing everything after the event)\n- **$15,000** budget for unexpected expenses and price offset (we can use some money to make invitations, rent more sailboats, buy more sails, stickers for boats, add more safety measures, shipping or storage for sails after the event etc)\n- **$10,000** I would like to request a small compensation for my efforts to plan the event for next 3 months.\n\n**Total: $160,000 or ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200)**\n\nWe are asking for $160,000. It is a lot of money but it is worth every dollar if you look at everything we are going to accomplish.\n\n----\n# Person in Charge\nI am [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev), member of Nouncil, creator of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), sailing since 2011, and love Nouns Community.\n\n---- \n# Multisig\nThe receiving address is a Gnosis Safe with 4/6 signers.\n\n**Multisig address**: 0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b\n\n**Multisig signers:**\n1. **toady_hawk**: 0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16\n2. **benbodhi**: 0x80826180A2629206E3499B5167aaC8440E3F87f6\n3. **adrianmcli**: 0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911\n4. **Brennen**: 0xf8a065f287d91d77cd626af38ffa220d9b552a2b\n5. **142**: 0xE6232ed3436C4065D38D8BFdC8EA90858ecDfa69\n6. **fiveoceans_dev**: 0xDf6e59c6DF1E9500fd35A76FF4C62F9901E90019\n\n$160,000 USD = ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200 USD)\nAdding 15% buffer for volatility: 154 ETH\n\n**Proposed Transaction**\n```\n0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b.transfer(\n 154.0 ETH\n)\n```\n\n### Swap Plan\nUpon receipt of funds, signers will convert the ETH to $160,000 USDC.\n- Leftover ETH will be sent back to Nouns DAO treasury\n- $60,000 USDC will be sent to fiveoceans_dev's wallet upon conversion\n    - the money will be used to book sailboats, and pre-order sails \n- $100,000 USDC will be kept in the safe until all the details of the Nouns NFT.NYC sailing event are finalized and posted (date, event program, sail designs, invitations)\n\n","endBlock":"16041898","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"107","id":"173","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xc2d4f2d86e9ff3415c7e0c3ee44c8819d25fe413","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1669046303","calldatas":["0x","0x000000000000000000000000cd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c9f78d2893e40000","0x00000000000000000000000028b59d90e4b04e8e19a64544a2658704230823a9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c9f78d2893e40000000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000638e860000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000644d4220","0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2","0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2","0xcd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888","0x28b59d90e4b04e8e19a64544a2658704230823a9"],"values":["33000000000000000000","0","0","5500000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"518","startBlock":"16033833","signatures":["deposit()","approve(address,uint256)","createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)",""],"quorumVotes":"52","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"2","againstVotes":"1","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"16019433","createdTransactionHash":"0xc3b182116a41331520603c02be605d0286d1b63a459c4c2f05448ed4ae4270f5","description":"# Proposal tracking by maty\n\n**TLDR**: Fund maty to continue tracking all funded [proposals](http://www.proposal.wtf) (46 ETH saved) and writing [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/) (over 16k views) for 5.5 ETH/month.\n\n## About me\nActive in nouns every day for a year, founding Nouncil and Esports Pod member, Discord mod (rip), NSFW team member... but most of my work has been centered around a weekly newsletter and proposal tracking dashboards I have created in Notion.\n\n## Tracking proposals\n**Problem:**  It's hard to follow individual projects after they get funded, the information is scattered.

Conveying a good idea in a way that voters can understand and relate to is even more difficult.  With the increased number of proposals and ideas coming in weekly, it’s more important than ever to effectively communicate one's idea and value proposition.  For some builders, proposal writing may not be a core strength. So their proposals may fail on-chain, even if the core concept is valuable.\n    \n2. **Effective Communication with DAO Voters is Difficult**\n    \n    One of the most difficult challenges for builders in the Nouns ecosystem has always been figuring out how to have open dialog with voting Nouners and Delegates. These challenges will only increase as the DAO grows. Now, with the Official Nouns Discord closed, this is an even more pressing issue. \n    \n3. **Constructive and Honest Feedback is Rare**\n    \n    Very few people within Nouns are giving truly honest and constructive criticism to proposals that need work. Discourse and Nouncil feedback sometimes can be “soft”, as people may not want to publicly discuss the potential pitfalls of a fellow community member’s idea or hurt their feelings.  We see this occurring more frequently with on-chain proposals, and it doesn’t help anyone in the long run.\n\n\n\n[![boxbrain.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/14xN6w0Y/boxbrain.gif)](https://postimg.cc/wRVvYtGh)*Think INSIDE the box!*\n\n\n# Our Solutions\n\n**PropBox will aim to solve the above pain points in the following ways:**\n\n1. Ugly Dao has a talented roster of builders, many of whom have experience writing successful proposals for Prop House, NSFW and on-chain. We also have professionals with experience in the legal, marketing, education, and communications fields. With our combined training and experience, we can help builders create proposals that make an impact. Additionally, sometimes the most difficult part of seeking funding from Nouns is **knowing where to go.** We can help proposers understand if their idea is best suited to a Prop House round, an NSFW pitch, a discussion with the newly minted DCS Pod, or a full on-chain proposal. Finally, we believe that proposals should lean on multimedia content to achieve maximum impact in an attention-scarce environment. We want to help builders integrate engaging videos and visuals into their proposals.\n\n2. We know the Nouns community like the back of our Ugly hand, and can help new builders navigate the difficult task of amplifying the message of their proposal. From appearances on The Noun Square, discussions in Nouncil or other Nounish discords, as well as conversations on Twitter, Discourse, House of Nouns and elsewhere, we know how to help builders with the most difficult part of getting funded for a proposal: **Communicating directly with the people who ultimately will vote yes or no.** \n\n3. The DAO needs more well-intentioned people who are not afraid to give would-be builders The Ugly Truth, and we are prepared to do so.\n\n\n# The PropBox Value Prop\n\nOur goal is to become the premier resource to help builders create great proposals and find pathways to funding in the Nouns ecosystem. We plan to find and incubate teams and projects from multiple sources, including:\n\n- Current builders in the ecosystem who are looking for feedback and help navigating the proposal process.\n- New builders who need extra help onboarding into Nouns, writing proposals, and making the right connections to be successful.\n- “Uncut gems” from Prop House and Discourse to fund proof of concept projects and prepare the teams for potential larger on-chain proposals in the future. We aim to find builders with the highest potential and help them fulfill that potential. Ideas from this category should have at least 10x potential from the amount of initial funding.\n\n# The Origin Story\n\nThis project began as an initiative by [Andrew ](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)[Laddusaw](https://twitter.com/AndrewLaddusaw), through [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil), following the [Combinator Round in Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-25-eth) back in July (aka “the before times.”) Andrew saw a lot of talented teams that submitted great proposals, but of course the round only had one winner for the 25ETH prize. \n\nHe began contacting builders and building a system within Nouncil Discord to give these teams feedback to prepare them for an on-chain proposal, or to help them secure alternative funding sources. When they began reviewing proposals publicly as a group, other builders asked for help as well.\n\nDuring this initial trial, the Incubator team gave feedback to 9 proposals. Through that process: One secured funding through NSFW. One pursued another Prop House to fund a proof of concept, won, and later joined Nouncil. One ended up abandoning the initial idea, but moved on to other projects during the incubation process, and has now been funded for multiple other projects within the DAO (shout out [ripe0x](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth).) Two other proposals ended up with on-chain votes, one narrowly being defeated and one securing funding for 40 ETH (Prop 144 for One Click Bots). \n\n[![andre-testimonial.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/JnndSt6P/andre-testimonial.gif)](https://vimeo.com/774010662/b852cb4533)\n*Click to watch a 2 minute PropBox testimonial video from Andrei (BotFrens)*\n\nWe learned a lot through this experiment. We’re continuing to follow up with the builders as they hone their ideas, and expect to see even more fruit from these efforts in the coming months. We’re also continuing to improve our feedback process and we believe we’re ready for the next phase of growth.\n\n\n# The Timeline\n\n**This proposal will support the PropBox team for a 3 month period to do the following:**\n\n- Actively locate builders in the ecosystem to help drive their ideas forward and guide them through the proposal process that is most appropriate to their ideas and building stage.\n- Create an active Builder’s Guild in the PropBox Discord, where those who are creating tools and proposals can do so in the open, and together. This well help create consistent startup energy in the Nouns community.\n- Review every Discourse, and various Discord community posts, making sure everyone submitting proposal ideas gets quality feedback and the best possible Nouns experience when they first arrive in the community. One of our greatest desires is that new, talented builders would not leave the community discouraged after getting negative feedback, simply because they didn’t understand the funding process or the culture of what it means to be a part of Nouns.\n- Create a website to house a toolkit of templates, best practices, tips and tricks, and contact information giving builders a toolbox to maximize success.\n- We will also spend the next three months exploring several ideas, which we will present to the community at the end of the proposal funding period:\n    - *How to potentially make an incubator like this self-sustaining in the future.*\n    - *A system to temperature check proposals and gather feedback from as many sources as possible, including from those with the most likelihood to swing vote outcomes.*\n    - *How to create efficiencies in the proposal process, so that new community members can transition from their first interactions to building as effectively as possible within the DAO.*\n    - *Exploring systems of trust-building to make sure that scammers are not able to abuse the treasury through gaming or fraud.*\n    - *Decisions about what form this group should take in the future; how to incorporate new members, ideas, and processes to maintain the highest degree of quality feedback, help, and value to the DAO.*\n\n\nAll of the above is to serve the ultimate goals of PropBox: \n\n**To help builders write high quality proposals, and to make decision-making simpler and less time-consuming for DAO members.**\n\n# The Budget\n\n**75ETH** **Total**\n\n- **60 ETH** - In our trial, we were able to achieve a great deal of success with people who were just volunteering their time. We know that with DAO funding, we will have much more capacity to onboard talented builders and incubate many more proposals. \n    - **20 ETH** per month as a payment to team members, to be paid retroactively based on work completed and builders helped. This work will include engaging builders at every stage of the proposal process, guiding them, and helping to write effective and media-rich proposals. These team rewards will be distributed via biweekly Coordinape rounds (Nouncil model.) All payment data will be publicly available to the DAO. \n    - Our team goal will be to engage with a minimum of 30 builders about their proposals over the course of a 3 month period. \n    \n- **10 ETH** for a pool to fund some small projects, as an experiment in additional targeted flexible funding for the DAO: Taking small ideas that we encounter through the process of our work and helping those teams to execute small ideas or create MVPs of larger ones. \n- **5 ETH** of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already.\n\n# The PropBox Team\n\nWe are a group of Nounish builders that have created and executed successful proposals at every funding level. We are consistently active in Discourse, offering constructive feedback and working privately with builders to help them formulate effective proposals and seek funding. We are passionate about great ideas, effective communication, and robust proposals that drive the nounish meme forward. ⌐◨-◨\n\n[![propbox-group-shot-smaller.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvQ8CwwZ/propbox-group-shot-smaller.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZWB9Gr1r)\n\n- ***Lead: [Andrew Laddusaw](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)***\n- ***Core Team:***\n***[BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)***\n***[ProfWerder](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/profwerder.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n***[SuperTightWoody](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/supertight.eth)***\n***[Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n\n***Support: Other UglyDAO Members***\n*18 super builders and counting with diverse skills and talents who are passionate ambassadors for Nouns inside and outside of the community*\n\n**Multisig:**\n*Funds will be transferred to and held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe (propboxvault.eth) with the 5 trusted Nouns community members above.*\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nWe believe the DAO needs to attract more awesome builders, and needs teams of diligent people finding good ideas and helping them to bloom into full-fledged, effective Nounish initatives. \n\nWe are uniquely qualified to help these builders write awesome proposals, strategize ideal funding paths, and facilitate DAO communications, and we are asking for a mandate to do exactly that. \n\n## Think INSIDE the Box, vote YES for Prop 175!

Periodically, I've seen a tonne of contests hosted by our nounish communities such as [coloring book contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/nounsense-02) by Noun22 & Messhup, [memes contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/noadz-valentines-day) by Noadz, and is now mainly being held by the [Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) team. We have seen full of delightful contest submissions with all sorts of genres from all across the world.\n\nI took an initiative to build a website where we can display all of the entries from NounsDAO's contestants because I personally feel it is very important for the DAO to do so. Additionally, it provides access to all future possibilities. \n\nAs time passes, I feel it needs to grow even more by including all of the Nouns projects from the community and not only the contestants. Our memes proliferations are all contained inside.\n\nWhy is it important to document and archive these things?\n\n> \"The body continuously explores time and space. It holds our history, if we listen closely.\" -Chloe Chotrani\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aDIU2rB.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n* **Long-term Vision** ; \n    * To retain past and future historical key data of all talented builders & artists that contribute around Nouns ecosystem.\n\n* **Objective** ; \n    * 1) To help **onboard newcomers** that are interested in Nouns so they can catch a **glimpse** of what the project is all about. Navigation will be improved through enhanced visual design to create a stronger first impression.\n    * 2) **References that act as inspiration**. Drawing from references is beneficial because it provides our imaginations with tangible things to model after.\n    * 3) To create potential opportunity for artists / builders to receive **commissions or collaborative works/projects** with others.\n\n* **Strategy** ; \n    * 1) **Simplified TL;DR / streamlined landing page with upgraded visuals** consists of ; *to browse relevant areas & specific parameters* ;\n            * simplified projects/contests brief\n            * project owner/hosts\n            * total funded/prizes\n            * categories (*ex; art, community, tech, marketing, physical etc*)\n            * links to discourse/full props/related infos/contests\n            * social media (*ex; twitter, discord*)\n            * tags / filters *(most recent, oldest, alphabetically)*\n            * distinct project images with descriptions\n            * status\n            * contest winners\n            * CC0 label together with proof of CC0 (*ex; toggle/submit forms etc*)\n            * search bar with data points\n            *( all are shown under **Details**)*\n\n    * 2) **Coordinate with other existing platforms** already in place (ex. ***[nouns.center](https://nouns.center/), [proposal.wtf](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860), [nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish)***) by pooling resources & efforts for maximum efficiency and also to complement each other.\n    * 3) **Contents sustainability** ; we will be using Notion for the database and will be publically viewable. Content submission form with formats will be available for community use. An additional idea is to work with Nouns AI team for data scraping by using certain hashtags/keywords *(to be discuss)*.\n    * 4) **CC0 Contents & Icon** ; any artist can **enable or declare** their work to be CC0 by submitting forms that will be made available soon. It is freely usable by anyone for remixing and other creative purposes. A \"CC0\" icon will appear that contains additional proof of CC0.\n    * 5) A **daily dose of nounish things** ; daily curated posting of one random nounish project to give more **visibility & brand consistency** for long term goals.\n    * 6) Main whiteboard to organise works ; [Nouns Archive's FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/g1etPE6nK6WtwK35i9C8gs/Nouns-Archive?node-id=0%3A1).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YtMFFYJ.jpg)\n\n* **Measuring Success** ; \n    * 1) We are tracking using Google Analytics and will factor in a monthly report & insights of the website.\n    * 2) As per *image* attached, it is an event count for 2 months. \n    * 3) Organic views and engagements will always be the baseline metrics, but currently, **85%** of the contents are exclusively focus on contest entries.

Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\" \n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.

The only place we actively incentivize them with ideas and funding is Prop House mandated rounds, which are retroactive, leaving builders who lose the round uncompensated for their work. Otherwise, they must figure out problems themselves and then ask for money, a difficult process if someone has no connections to the ecosystem.\n\n**Solution:** Create a program to actively recruit new talented builders and pro-actively fund them to explore the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### TL;DR\n* 1 grant = 10 ETH for 2 months of exploration, goal for each builder is to have an on-chain prop by end of the period\n* 5 builders (50 ETH total) in first trial run\n* 3 members on operations team (mrtn, jihad, dot), lightly compensated; 2 more on multi-sig (yitong and krel)\n* Transparency is key\n\n### Eligibility\n- Must NOT be actively or recently funded by Nouns, or clearly an existing participant in the Nouns ecosystem\n- Must be new to the broader Nouns ecosystem\n- Must be working / actively exploring _something_ directly related to NounsDAO while on grant, or it will be revoked\n- Preference for people who can proactively create independently — particularly engineers, but also content creators, designers, writers, etc\n\n### Operation Details\nThe entire process will be transparent via a public Discord and run by the 3-person team, who will be lightly compensated to do this work, ensuring accountability and commitment. Our initial proposal had no funding for the team, but we were recommended otherwise by Nouners.\n\n**Public Application:**\n* Explorer Grants will be publicized via Twitter, 1:1 outreach from the team and its network, Twitter Spaces with Nouns community organizations, Discords, etc\n* Candidates will submit public applications, showing past work and motivations for exploring the Nouns ecosystem, as well as a couple problem spaces that interest them\n  * These applications will also benefit the community at large who can recruit builders from this group\n* Candidates will largely be assessed on talent, potential, and excitement about Nouns. Reasoning for accepted candidates will be made public. The 3-person team will decide on 4 final candidates to accept.\n* 1 slot in the program will be allocated to a Nouns community vote\n\n**Program:**\n* 10 ETH for 2 months of part-time exploration for each builder\n  * *Detail: Overpaying slightly is critical to attracting talent that may not otherwise come to us. We are targeting people who make more than $150,000 a year in their full-time job*\n* Weekly check-in call with builders. Members of the Explorer Grants team will help them explore ideas, connect them to Nouners and builders, and lead workshops\n* **End of Program Objective:** each builder submits an on-chain or Prop House prop for continued funding\n\n### Team\n* **mrtn, lead organizer:**\n    * Previously a PM at Google and NBA Top Shot, he has now contributed to a variety of Nounish projects - Nouns Builder, AI Pod, Agora, as well as doing a 24 Hour Nounish live stream, and receiving a Governance Historian grant. At USC, he ran an organization that guided students towards entrepreneurship, whose members include several YC startups. He's a big believer in diversifying funding sources for Nouns builders, and experimenting with the patronage model. *Comp: 3 ETH / month*\n* **jihad, community & product expert:**\n    * Core contributor at Forefront, creating media and building infrastructure for tokenized communities. He is also a delegate and “Lil Nouncilor” at Lil Nouns DAO, a contributor to Public Nouns, one of the winners of the recent Nouns Agora delegate race, and is part of the team building [Adjectives](nouns.terminal.co), an analytics and proposal evaluation platform for Nouns DAO. Jihad believes that Nouns must be a center of excellence for tokenized communities, and the Explorer Grants program would be a step in the right direction in attracting the brightest minds to do focused yet unstructured work in the Nouns ecosystem. *Comp 2 ETH / month*\n* **dot, technical expert:**\n    * Dot is an iOS dev turned nounish builder - a founding member of Nouncil and most recently Lil Nounder at Lil Nouns DAO; the first full fork of Nouns DAO. Dot started Lil Nouns as a way to expose nouns to as many people as possible. Lil Nouns DAO leverages its 8 nouns alongside its own treasury to fund and support public goods built by lil nouners. In doing so, Lil Nouns has become a builder onramp to Nouns DAO itself. *Comp: 2 ETH / month*\n\n***We will use a 3 of 5 multi-sig, with the core team members as well as krel and yitong.***\n\n### Questions\n**How will you actually find these builders?** Our team has fairly deep networks within the crypto and broader tech space; we'll leverage our personal connections as well as our social media presence to find more builders. Additionally, a large appeal of programs like these (Thiel Fellowship, Prop House, MacArthur Grants) is the benefit of continued funding + prestige, which we intend to lean into.\n\n**But what if the builders don't do anything?** This is similar to everything in Nouns already - there's a social contract to uphold, someone could always dissapear after receiving 200 ETH on-chain. We can setup the grant via Sablier to revoke if a builder goes MIA, however.\n\n**What will they actually build?** The first round will not have a particular mandate but future ones could be structured closer to Prop House mandated rounds, where there is a theme. We believe that time and freedom is key to allowing talented builders to find something meaningful to build long-term.\n\n**Why not just run this on Prop House?** Decisions are not always best made by large committees. Prop House rounds do not allow for deep conversation and analysis of candidates. A transparent, small committee allows for depth and betting on candidates who might not otherwise get a shot (i.e. people who aren't good at writing a description on prop house but would be amazing builders). Additionally, we'd like to create a long-term relationship with these builders via an organized cohort.\n\n**What if no good work comes out of this?** That's a possibility, as is the case with prop house rounds. However, we believe that Nouns already has a great enough brand to attract solid builders. However, if nothing goods comes out of this trial, then we will have learned that pro-active grants for attracting builders is not a valid technique for our DAO. If there are takeaways, they can be adapted into other funding sources, like Prop House or NSFW in the future.\n\n**Why are you being paid?** Our initial proposal did not include payment for the team, but it was suggested by Nouners that we should be getting paid to create accountability, as well as allow us to dedicate more time in making this more of a full-fledged program than one-off grants with no support from us.\n\n### Total Funding\n5 Builders x 10 ETH = 50 ETH\nTeam Comp: 14 ETH\nTotal: 64 ETH\n\n***Questions?

It’s like Adult Swim on a dozen espresso shots, in one-minute-or-less episodes, released as 1/1 NFTs.\n\nThis is an opportunity to expand Nouns DAO culture by unleashing highly visible artist-created, community-developed CC0 video content that can be distributed everywhere. It’s also a brand-new way to use web3 tooling to release episodic videos, and an opportunity to pioneer a decentralized media production model that can help inform the future of entertainment. \n**takes a breath*\n\nRead on and watch the below video to learn more.\n\n[![Worst Case Decision](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/Nouns_WCD_Pitch_vid_screenshot_1500x.jpg)\n](https://vimeo.com/772223496/a53f2e2dad \"Worst Case Decision\")\n\n\n## What’s Worst Case Decision?\nWorst Case Decision is maybe the first episodic “show” to be released as an NFT series.\n\nEach season of WCD features 7 bite-sized fever dreams that are handcrafted into 30-70 second “episodes.” Every episode chases surreal characters along a bat-shit hyper-casual narrative that loosely follows a theme. So far we’ve explored themes such as “mayonnaise portal,” “everyone is wet,” “hi-fi asparagus rain,” and “too many cats,” to name a few.\n\nThe show’s vibe feels like surfing in a sea of technicolor absurdity, with a low-fi, internet-infused, stop-motion animation style. Video, painting, web3, DALL-E, comedy, commerce… WCD has it all. (Scroll to the bottom of this proposal to view sample episodes.)\n\n**Worst Case Decision Quick Facts:**\n\n* 50 Seasons planned, 7 episodes per season (350 episodes total)\n* Episodes released episodically as 1/1 video NFTs via worstcasedecision.com\n* Each season features an ever-changing cast of characters and collaborators\n* NFTs can be purchased with credit card and digital currency (ETH)\n\n## What makes this exciting for Nouns DAO?\nWe’re at the dawn of a new era for entertainment—one that will enable audiences and creators to build sustainable models of cultural production together. As perhaps the first-ever serialized 1/1 NFT video collection, Worst Case Decision is taking a pioneering approach to launching meme-y, weird, funny narrative shorts with and for the communities who believe this kind of art should exist in the world. \n\nBeyond pioneering this new web3-native episodic production model, there are a few specific benefits that Nouners can expect from supporting this project:\n\n**Noun-ified Episodes**\nThe entire season will be built based on decentralized creative direction by opening up key decisions to the Nouners (and in some cases the internet at large, for max visibility). This includes community input/voting on:\n* The “themes” of each episode\n* Protagonists (I’ve got so many weird character ideas, man)\n* Supporting cast (really, so many weird characters)\n* Episode backgrounds\n\n**CC0 Content & Nouns Memes**\nThe Nouns season of WCD will be entirely CC0. This means that anyone can meme the shit out of the entire season, which will be full of Nouns references, noggles, and other inside jokes specific to Nouns’ community, culture, and lore. Cut up and re-mix the episodes however y’all see fit, and post wherever you want.\n\n**Additional Benefits to Nouns DAO**\n\n1)\t**Major marketing and PR exposure.** This is a first-of-its-kind video collection in the NFT space, and there’s “a lot of press to be had.”\n2)\t**WCD is planned for 50 seasons.** Nouns would be the 3rd season of 50, and the first-ever sponsored season—representing an early entry into supporting what could become a historic release.\n3)\t**Introduce Marc’s audience to Nouns.** I’ve been an independent artist for 25 years, and as a result I’m decently well known. I can help bring the fine art world’s attention to Nouns and web3 at large.\n4)\t**Reach non-web3-savvy folks, too.** Our tech partner [Hashku](https://hashku.com) has both crypto-native and custodial credit card minting solutions, meaning that non-crypto folks can participate in NFT auctions.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/nouns_pfp_collage%20copy_sm.jpg)\n\nThese are just mere examples of potential Nouns x WCD characters! Glorious, yes? Please feel free to take ‘em and make ‘em [your PFPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ff52SL1p3PGzdxYtCO7kyA9kpE2N4EAY?usp=share_link). (Shhhh…. there will be plenty more via https://nouns.build/ in the future.) \n\n## What makes this exciting for Collectors?\nI care immensely about my collectors. I want to add value and make the experience as fun and engaging as the episodes themselves. We have an expansive vision and are thrilled to include our collectors along this journey. \n\nIf you are a holder of a WCD episode from any season, you’ll get access to:\n\n* My network via a private discord channel for collectors (a seat on the board so to speak)\n* Input on IRL WCD events\n* Early access to future WCD collabs and projects  \n\n## Marketing & Community Development\nOur philosophy for marketing and PR follows the vision for the project. Simply put: Our weird creative vision and IRL performances are going to cause some really interesting responses, which we’ll engage with using our built-in strengths with social media and PR.\n\n**Marketing Plan**\n\n* **Launch activities** – Our team will produce strategic content and a mix of online and IRL activations to generate as much pre-launch awareness as possible. We have an existing list of interested & interesting media partners to engage here. The web3 PR agency Serotonin is among them.\n*  **High-velocity engagement** – A dedicated Project Ambassador will act as a marketing strategist, online social maestro, and Nouns champion, using multi-channel engagement tactics to build momentum. \n\n* **Partnerships & sponsorships** – I (Marc) have a long history of partnering with brands to co-create projects. We will be bringing on some truly exciting collaborators and sponsors to spread the word even farther.\n\n* **Long-term community growth** – Our desire is to make this project fully self-sustaining. To do this, our goal is to increase the performance of NFT auctions and overall engagement with the series by aggressively growing the WCD community. \n\n* **Transparent success metrics** – We will track and analyze meaningful engagement metrics to keep the community informed on how we’re doing, and to strengthen our marketing approaches overall.\n\n## Open-Sourcing Our Promo Strategy\n\nWe wish to be as transparent as possible with our learnings about marketing and running this project. We’ll create a public document outlining our goals, metrics, successes, and learnings so that our efforts can help future projects and the community at large.\n\n## Project Team\n\nIn addition to an amazing lineup of advisors, our core team currently consists of the following:\n\n**Marc Horowitz** // Creator & Visionary \n**Chris Coy** // Partner & Spiritual Advisor \n**Damien Newman** // Creative Consultant & Power Supporter \n**Matt Casanova** // Builder of Technologies\n**Hashku** // Minting Platform\n\n## Budget\nAnticipated activities and budgets (by phases):\n\n* **Pre-Production** – $9,650\nStudio usage, lighting equipment, episode concepting/ production planning for all 7 episodes, props, backgrounds, art department (hand making all the noggles and weird other props).\n\n* **Production** – $16,875 \nDirector fee, cinematographer/camera operator fee, additional creative direction and shoot crew/collaborators, daily incidentals during shoot (food, grip, etc), and production assistance.\n\n* **Post-Production** – $11,500 \nSound finishing/sfx/sound design, music licensing, editing, smart contract customizations for specific season NFTs, season-specific website costs (video bandwidth and hosting). \n\n* **Promotion of Nouns + WCD Season (Outreach/Marketing/PR)** – $17,475\nSpread the word about the Nouns DAO and its sponsored season of WCD via strategic editorial write ups, podcast appearances, live events, IRL media stunts/performances, and other activations TBD.  See further notes in “Marketing Plan” (above).\n\n\n**Total Budget** ($55,500) + price contingency: **50 ETH** (converted to USDC immediately) \n\n\n## Timeline & Logistics\n\n**Mid-late February, 2023:** Launch the project with unsponsored seasons 1 and 2.\n\n**Mid-January:** Collaborate with the Nouns community. Using voting mechanisms and other means of gathering community input, we will collectively shape WCD season 3.\n\n**Mid-late January:** Once our Nouns season is planned, each episode takes roughly 2 days to film and edit. That brings pre-production, production, and post-production to 3-4 weeks total.\n\n## How NFT Auctions Will Work on worstcasedecision.com\nEach season of WCD video episodes will be dropped over the course of a week (dates will be announced via [@marchorowitz](https://twitter.com/marchorowitz)).\n* Each day at 9am PST a new episode will drop on worstcasedecision.com\n* Each episode will be released as a 1/1 NFT \n* Each NFT’s auction will end at 8:55:59 am PST the following day\n* When one auction closes, the next one drops—and this continues for 7 days in a row, Mon–Sun.\n\n## The Future of WCD and Episodic NFTs\nWe have the team and vision required to evolve WCD into a genre-defining series. Beyond this, we think we’re onto something in regards to how serialized NFTs can be used as a sustainable model to fund the production of some truly weird and great videos—and other creations as well.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more and chatting with Marc and the team personally, please reach out and we’ll have a chat ;)\n\n## Thank you, Nouners!\nIf I get the chance to collaborate with you all, I know we can make something really fun and amazing.

We will hand pick, and noun pill, five of our favorite creators to complete the other 5 shorts.\n\n**The Rules**\n1. The short must be funny.\n2. The short must be 15 seconds.\n3. The short must feature at least one Noun.\n\nProposers will submit a portfolio (or at least one example of previous work) + a 1 sentence creative pitch for their short.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nOnce the 10 shorts are complete we will plan for an entertaining online premiere, looking to collaborate with people in the Nouniverse, creators, and media outlets with established audiences.

We will also provide the video files publically, allowing anyone to use them in future Nounish projects and news.\n\n**Awards**\n\nWe have an additional 20 ETH to award as prizes. We'll experiment with a variety of prizes and allocation methods including token gated Nounish community votes, live celebrity critic votes, and somehow we're going to get Goldy's dog to choose one prize winner. Also included will be a prize specifically for the best CC0 shorts to incentivize creators to release their content CC0.\n\nAll of our these additional prizes will be open to public submissions - artists not selected and funded through Prop House can create their short anyways and have another shot at competing for the prizes.\n\n**Branding**\n\n10 ETH is included to cover basic branding needed for this Prop House round.

Nouns X Everybody is more about the process itself (which could be applied to other areas, not just content creation). Additionally, although this proposal pays more to the winning submissions - it is doing so because it requires the team to produce AND distribute without a guarantee of payment. While the number of views are not everything, they do matter, as we can have the highest quality content in the world but it only matters if people see it. \n\nInstead of determining what we think people will want to see, this proposal will instead outline the guidelines in terms of output as well as the minimum result we want achieved in terms of outcome. Leaving it open for anyone to implement their own creative process in order to achieve that result.\n\nBy funding this the proposal we would hope to achieve the goals of:\n\n\n* Having a minimum of 10 pieces of original video content created, each with a minimum of 2k views on YouTube (20k total views minimum but I would expect much much more).\n* Getting new and innovative ideas from both from within and outside of our existing community by allowing them creative control on the output.\n* Bringing people into the Nouniverse as they will need to learn more about Nouns so as to create content which will enable them to win this challenge.\n* Showcase how the various elements of the DAO (see: ‘The Process’) can be combined to create a cohesive process for project implementation.\n* Demonstrating a proposal process that brings benefit to the DAO and rewards creators while not requiring compensation for the proposer. With 86% going to content creators, 12% going to marketing and just 1% going to administration along with 1% earmarked for an independent report on effectiveness of the proposal after 9 months. \n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE BRIEF\n\n**Create a short hype video that either explains or pulls people into the Nouniverse and if your video gets over 2k views on YouTube before April 30th 2023 you could be awarded part of the $200k fund.**\n\nThe **Top 10 Videos** ranked by number of YouTube views that meet the minimum entry requirements below will be put up for a vote where **4 winners** will be selected and awarded **$50k each**.\n\n* Any person or team is free to submit an entry to this challenge. \n* To enter, simply create your video, upload it to YouTube and get people to watch it.\n\n___\n\n_**MINIMUM QUALIFYING CRITERIA**_ \n\n- Has more than 2000 organic views on Youtube by the end of the Submission Period\n- Must meet the brief (i.e. It either ‘explains the Nouns’ or ‘pulls people into the Nouniverse’)\n- Content must be original. While videos may reuse existing content if it is not mostly original it will not qualify.\n- Is positive in nature and is rated PG\n- Must be a video and not a YouTube \"shorts\"\n- Should include ‘#EnterTheNouniverse’ in the description (so we can easily filter submissions)\n\n\n---\n\nComplete creative freedom is given to entrants on how they want to achieve the goal – it can be animated, live footage, a mixture of both or something completely different. Some teams might focus on higher end productions that explains Nouns to people while others might focus on something simple and unique that pulls people into the Nouniverse (i.e. see the different approach[ Coinbase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ9pNQrz0fA&ab_channel=AnthonyKalamut) had vs other cypto companies during the superbowl in trying to achieve the same result). It is up to the creator to do what they think will work.\n\n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n## SELECTION CRITERIA\n\nThe **Top 8 Videos with the most views on YouTube + 2 Videos chosen by the Selection Committee** will be entered into the Voting Round – where Noun holders will vote for the 4 winners of $50k each.\n\n\n\n* All videos must meet the minimum qualification criteria\n* Selected entries will be free to provide any additional information at this stage to be included in their entry which demonstrates why their content should win (for example, data from other social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok or any other measure of engagement)\n* Selected entries may be asked to provide information to the selection committee proving that their YouTube views were organic that the data has not been manipulated or paid for.\n* A person/team can submit as many entries as they want but only their best entry (which they can choose)  will be selected for the final vote.\n* We are including 2 videos selected by the committee due to the fact that some entries may not be in the Top 10 in terms of views of YouTube but may have merit for nomination through a disproportionate level of engagement on other channels and/or be of exceptional quality or have uploaded their video late in the process but has gained a lot of views in a short time period.\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE PROCESS\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the following process will take place:\n\n\n\n1. **Proposal Passes:** $200k and 25 Eth with be transferred to a multisig controlled by the Multisig. The challenge has officially started.\n2. **Submission Period:** There is a 5 Month window for anyone to create and publish their hype video.\n3. **Create Marketing Dept:** 25 Eth will immediately be used to fund a Prop House Round with 5 Eth being awarded to the 5 best proposals detailing how they will market and find entrants for this project. (see note at bottom)\n4. **Selection Period:** When the submission period has ended on April 30th 2023 there will be a 2 week selection period where the creators of the Top 10 videos will be invited by the Selection Committee to make their submissions. These submissions, including any additional information the creator wants to provide, will be uploaded to a Prop House round by the Selection Committee.The selection committee will be paid 3 eth for administering this.\n5. **Voting Round:** Nouns will have a 1 week voting period to cast their votes for the 4 winning submissions to be awarded $50k each.\n6. **Payment:** Funds will be distributed to the Winners by the Trusted Parties.\n7. **Analysis**: 2 eth will be earmarked for an indpedent evaluation of this proposal after 9 months. To see how effective it was at achieving the stated outcome. \n\n_**Important Note:** If no one meets the minimum qualifying criteria, the Nouns pay nothing (with the exception of the 25 eth used to fund the marketing dept prop house round) and all funds are returned to the Treasury. But for every person or team that does meet the criteria, we have at the very least a piece of original video content with more that 2k views on YouTube._ \n\n\n\n\n** **\n\n**Selection Committee:** The Selection committee will be comprised of 5 independent members of the Noun community, selected by Hindsight, whose job it will be: (a) select the Top 10 videos to be included in the final Noun vote as per the minimum qualifying criteria and the selection criteria above, (b) contact these creators to submit any additional information for the final vote and (c) upload those submissions to a Prop House vote.\n\nThe work of the selection committee is minimal and mostly administrative (checking that views are organic etc) and as such will only require 3 eth (of which I will get none).\n\n_In order to maintain independence and to ensure a fair process members of the selection committee cannot enter a video to the challenge_\n\n\n---\n\n**Stated Goals of this Proposal** \nIf this proposal passes, it success or failure will be measured against meeting the following criteria:\n* The creation of a minimum of 10 pieces of good quality, original content before April 30th\n* A minimum of 100k cumulative organic YouTube views across all content created in persuit of this prize before 9 months of this proposal passing\n___\n\n\n\n**Team** \nReally the point of this prop is that there is no 'team' but for the interest of transparency and to include a section I think should be in all props:\n* Hindsight: I am not a member of any other teams, councils or projects and I do not receive any compensation from any DAO source. I have no conflicts of interest and will not financially benefit from this proposal.\n* My only role will be to be on the multisig and to choose the selection commitee (A role I would be happy to give to someone else if they are suitable and want it!)\n\n\n---\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\n\n\n* 30 Eth will be transferred to fund a Prop House Round to create a marketing team for the challenge, the selection committee administration cost and the retrospective report on outcome.\n* $200k USD will be transferred to fund the prize pool.\n\n_If less than 4 teams do not meet the minimum qualifying criteria then any USDC that has not been used will be returned to the treasury._\n\n**Total Cost:** $200k + 30 Eth\n\n**Multisig**\n\nThe multisig is a 3/5 consisting of the 5 best looking members of the dao\n\n* [Hindsight](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight)\n* [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\n* [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\n* [Adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\n___\n\n**A note on the 'Marketing Dept' creation**\n\n\nThe prop house round for 25 eth will award 5 submissions 5 eth to market this challenge and try and find people and teams outside both inside and outside of Nouns to make submissions. I will draft the prop house round if this proposal succeeds. An idea of submissions that will be encouraged are: contacting media schools, creating a landing pages with instructions, engaging with influencers to promote etc. \n\n___\n\n\n**Why YouTube Views**\n\n\nAs stated earlier, YouTube views are not everything, but they do matter and after looking at the view count of Nouns content I think we could benefit from a proposal with a proposal that has goals in terms of distribution as well as production. \n\nMany of these videos will have more views on Twitter and other platforms and I would expect the same from any video created for this challenge. But for the interest of managing the proposal we will have to set one medium as the primary one for measurement and I think YouTube is the most appropriate.\n\n2k views to reach the minimum entry requirement may seem small, and it is, but remember this is a MINIMUM, and we would expect any video that qualifies in the Top 10 to have many more views than that. \n\nHere you can see how many views Nounish content is currently getting on YouTube\n[![YT-V.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XYSbwxm9/YT-V.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bsTWP0zv)\n\nWhile some content that that use gimmicks, shows a lack of creativity nor effort, or does not show a clear comprehension of what the Nouns ecosystem is may meet the minimum qualifying criteria (whether due to the creator having large existing YouTube following or otherwise), ultimately the winning pieces of content be decided upon by a Nouner vote and so are extremely unlikely to be awarded anything for their efforts. So anyone who creates a video with the expectation of success should keep it classy and keep it Nounish.   \n","endBlock":"16164466","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"89","id":"181","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321dad0a0bf9a148","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":0}},{"createdTimestamp":"1670387195","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x9c74ae08fd4337e14786f086d911e964df35e623"],"values":["49400000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"536","startBlock":"16144888","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"80","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"74","againstVotes":"64","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"16130488","createdTransactionHash":"0xb6903e6cf93fd8e833746c5a35aa95736fd2c8f71d18a869eefac913b0342263","description":"# Nouns AR Filters\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- Create 37 additional Augmented Reality Noun heads (increasing from 13 to 50 on Snapchat)\n- Heads will be fully expressive with responsive eyes, mouth, eyebrows, and custom animations\n- For the first time, bring all 50 Noun heads and 23 glasses to TikTok and Instagram\n\n**Why?**\n- AR filters can fully replace a person’s head or overlay Noggles to:\n  - Record Nounish content within Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok. \n  - Live stream as a Noun on Zoom, Discord, Twitch, etc.\n  - Remix and Nounify TV and movie clips to make memes\n\n**Compensation: 49.4 ETH**\n\n---\n## MEMES AND LIVESTREAMS\n![](https://imgur.com/sSv90Sh.jpeg)\n*Remixing existing footage and Nounifying it*\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/7N5B1WA.jpeg)\n*Noun Square live stream*\n\n[![](https://imgur.com/cEfJSf7.jpeg)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)\n[*Twitch stream by Dota2 Esport Team*](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/R60fKbf.jpeg)\n*On-chain proposal using the filters*\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/LeMQ1NN.jpeg)\n![](https://imgur.com/PEW6XYS.jpeg)\n*Simple GIFs made with [Snap AR filter noggles](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=d1507087c8f5479f89a73464805f76cb&amp;metadata=01), see [Tenor page](https://tenor.com/users/coralorca).*\n\n[![](https://imgur.com/dq8BsTw.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG14_cNTFqY)\n*[Nouns Coffee unboxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG14_cNTFqY)*\n\n---\n## **VALUE PROPOSITION**\n\nThe Snap filters I created previously were used by the Dota2 Esport team (See [Grand Finals livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)), the Noun Square team (see [PropHouse winners interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOP8N49QBTc)), Nounish videos (currently in production) and can be seen in some on-chain proposals and memes across Twitter and Discord. \n\nThere is an increasing demand for Nounish content creation tools, and I often get the question: **\"Wen my Noun in AR?\".**\n\nWe are in the media propagation phase of Nouns, and with the expectation of AR-VR glasses becoming a main computational platform in the near future, Nouns should be AR-ready.\n\nI propose to craft an initial set of 50 heads as expressive Augmented Reality filters, with responsive eyes, mouth, and eyebrows motion, as well as fun animations, depending on each Noun (e.g. a dripping brush, a fin flapping shark etc).\n\nThese filters will be simultaneously published on Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nNouns AR filters can be used for :\n* Nounish Videos / interviews / social reels\n* Live streaming / podcasts\n* Undoxxed video calls\n* Memes and GIFs.

The geometry has to be considered individually, and some traits are more challenging than others. This is a similar process to what I went through when translating all 2D Nouns to 3D voxels with 3Dnouns.com. You can speed up the pipeline with work habits and experience, but each head requires specific attention to craft the Nounish details that make the difference.\n\n## **METRICS**\nI will share metrics from the different social platforms with the community.\nHere are some metrics from the Snapchat filters created with Prophouse funding and some recently published filters on TikTok.\n\n#### TIKTOK\n![](https://imgur.com/Qdb7oSX.jpeg)\n###### Close to 20k plays in two weeks with 0 marketing.\n\n#### SNAPCHAT\n\n![](https://imgur.com/PFoW7Ri.jpeg)\n\n###### The Robot Noun’s head has almost 600k plays in November! This is an interesting case of side effect proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/T1NMuqt.jpeg)\n\n###### BudLight was the first filter created, and currently totals over 4k plays.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **PORTING MODELS TO INSTAGRAM AND TIKTOK**\nI will import the 50 models to Meta’s and TikTok’s AR authoring software (respectively *SparkAR* and *Effect House*) to publish them to Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and TikTok and reach a wider audience. \nRegarding the workflow, the 3D assets will be re-used, however, they still need to be imported, positioned, scaled, lit and the animation triggers need to be configured on an individual basis and depending on each software capabilities. \nFrom a technical standpoint Snap Lens Studio > SparkAR > TikTok Effect house. My goal is to make each Noun head as consistent as technically possible across all different platforms. See Frog head above.\n\n## **WHICH NOUN AND WHEN**\nI will deliver between 10 and 20 heads per month, released on the three platforms simultaneously as they are created. I will create community requested heads first, and otherwise will craft the traits that I think will be the most successful. \n👉Here is an open To-do if you want to add your favorite traits to the list: \nhttps://www.notion.so/Filters-List-1b12bdc8b51e42f4b726b650b3784f7a\n\n![](https://imgur.com/lrjR7ac.jpeg)\n\n###### Potential AR Filters candidates \n\n## **COMPENSATION**\nFor the Prophouse winning rounds, I suggested 4 filters for 2 ETH, when ETH was around 1800-2000 USD. The market price for such 3D AR lenses sits between 1500-5000 USD per filter. \nFor reference, [this MAYC filter I created](https://www.instagram.com/ar/1025321405001469/) was commissioned by LollaPalooza for Snapchat and IG and was around 5k USD - It is a little more complex with many eyes and snot coming out of the nose.\n\nWith ETH currently around 1200 USD, I adjusted the price to 3 filters for 2 ETH, around 800 USD.\n\n- Setting up the geometry and creating the expressions system for each of the 37 heads in Blender.\n**(37/3) * 2 = 24.7**\n\n- Porting the geometry to TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, setting up the animation triggers and publishing to these platform with consistent tagging and video previews.\nI am estimating this work at 0.18 ETH per filter for a total of 137 filters.\n**(50 on TikTok + 50 on Instagram + 37 on Snapchat) * 0.18 = 24.7**\n\nThis brings the total ask at **49.4 ETH** with an average price of 0.36 ETH per filter. \n\n---\n\n## **ETH ADDRESS**\n\n0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623\n\n## **WHO I AM**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/jmO7FHf.jpeg)\n\nCoral Orca:\n- Community member \n- Early Nouncillor\n- 3D buildor: visualization with voxels, AR and VR, architecture and art. \n- [Prop 2](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2) we created [https://3dnouns.com](https://3dnouns.com/) with [0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xfloyd)\n- [Prop 126](https://nouns.wtf/vote/126) With [John Hamon](https://twitter.com/johnhamon_)\n\nHappy to be here, and build with my internet friends. \n\nThank you for reading this proposal!\n\nFeel free to tag me on Twitter or Discord to answer any questions.

Over that time period, Prop House has become a core piece of infrastructure for the development of the Nouns ecosystem – onboarding a sizable percentage of the most impactful builders while spreading the Nouns meme far and wide. We are requesting 570 ETH to continue to fund development of Prop House over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).*\n\n---\n\n***State of the Prop House(s):**\nOn Dec 1st, 2022, Seneca hosted an open call to update the community on what we’ve been up to since the [proposal #105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105). You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbJsbXWCPxbMyE25Xr_kfQjJJYMtGw0HEYuLrtdkndI/edit?usp=sharing) and recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD9v1ihIRmw).*\n\n---\n\n## Onboarding builders\nThe most important outcome of Prop House for Nouns has been its ability to onboard a large percentage of the most impactful builders in the ecosystem. **More than funding, the core feature of Prop House is about activating builders**. Whether it be for folks who had never heard of Nouns before or those who were just hanging around, Prop House was the mechanism that took them from inactive to building within the ecosystem.\n\nGiven Nouns is about bottom-up brand building as opposed to top-down centralized direction, we hope that Prop House can continue to serve as a tool to execute on that Nouns vision. Below is a list of some of the builders who’ve been activated by Prop House:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZeeWk9.png)\n\n## Where we are today by the numbers\nOur last proposal ([#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)) passed on July 18, 2022. Since then, we’ve made substantial progress on all core Prop House KPIs:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JtrkRUm.png)\n\nAll our charts are seeing sustained month-over-month growth despite market downturns:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fBw6qTd.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P5rXSsH.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4q3e9hS.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jr1bwSR.jpg)\n\nThe funnel from prop award to prop completion has maintained a high conversion rate. Close to 85% of all prop winners go on to complete their proposed work. Below is an analysis on all prop winners from all funding rounds within the [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns) (18 funding rounds and 105 awarded proposals):\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H71CV2j.jpg)\n\n## Spreading the Nouns meme\nOver the past 5 months we’ve onboarded several communities, most notably [Meebits](https://prop.house/meebits) via [Ape Coin DAO funding](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-110-meebits-prophouse-sponsored-by-apecoin/8219). By doing so, Prop House has spread the Nouns meme far beyond our immediate community. In tandem with Prop House growth comes furthering the reach of the Nouns meme along with what Nouns stands for: building.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nTQsPIo.jpg)\n\n## Product\nThe Prop House team has been busy working on the core product ([prop.house](https://prop.house)). A brief summary of what we’ve done follows:\n\n- Contracted one the best designers in the space (0xHab from Rainbow)\n- Revamped UI across the entire app\n- Implemented multi-round houses\n- Upgraded voting UX\n- Open sourced the [repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/).\n- Released a [GraphQL interface](https://prod.backend.prop.house/graphql) for Prop House data which lead to projects like [NounsAtlas](https://nounsatlas.com), [Voters.wtf](https://voters.wtf) and [Nounish.cv](https://nounish.netlify.app/)\n\n## Protocol\nWe’ve also made strides in the development of the Prop House protocol.\n\nThe protocol leverages both Ethereum and Starknet in an effort to provide the best possible user experience. This dual-chain architecture enables Prop House users to propose and vote by signing a message, while decentralizing the entire funding flow.\n\nWe use Ethereum as the operations and execution layer, where houses are managed and payouts are made, while Starknet handles all user actions that occur within a funding round.\n\nAll of the code is publicly available today in the [Prop House repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol).\n\nBelow are some of the core pieces of infrastructure we’ve developed to support the protocol, where we are currently, and what to expect as we near mainnet launch:\n\n- The [protocol](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-contracts) itself, which has been deployed to Goerli.\n- The [Prop House SDK](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-sdk), which simplifies interaction with the protocol (L1 & L2).\n- The Starknet Relayer, which is responsible for submitting signed proposals and votes to Starknet on behalf of users.\n- Ethereum & Starknet subgraphs, which are currently in development.\n- Current blockers:\n    - [Cairo V1 Migration](https://medium.com/starkware/open-sourcing-cairo-1-0-b3100a664bb0)\n    - [Support for V1 on StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-regenesis-the-plan-bd0219843ef4) (expected Q1 ‘23)\n    - Protocol audits (pending testing on testnet)\n\nAssuming no major hiccups, we aim to deploy the protocol to mainnet before the end of Q1 2023.\n\n## Financials\n*The Prop House financials doc is publicly available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\nOver the course of one year and three proposals ([#23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23), [#62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)), Nouns DAO has funded the Prop House team 555 ETH for deploying towards Nouns builders and 695 ETH for development and operating expenses.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oxC4c8l.png)\n\n*Note: current burn rate for Nouns funding rounds is low (~20-30 ETH / mo). If at any point the DAO chooses to have another party deploy Nouns House Funding, we will return all remaining funds to the DAO.*\n\n## What’s next?\n### Protocol launch\nWe are aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of Q1 2023. What follows is the timeline we are executing against to get to launch:\n\n- Migrate to Cairo V1\n- Complete Goerli testing\n- Finalize Prop House SDK & Starknet Relayer\n- Launch subgraphs for Ethereum & Starknet\n- Developer documentation\n- Protocol audit\n\n### Product development\nAlongside the transition to the protocol as the data layer, we will continue to develop the UX of app:\n- Core UX: better proposing, discovery and voting user experiences.\n- The launch of house and round managers such that anyone can create a house, deposit funds and initiate funding rounds.\n- Implementation for infinite rounds for grant pods to run their entire operation via Prop House.\n- Develop social features for communities. \n\n## Sustainability\nThere are several avenues to explore on how to make Prop House sustainable. For the time being, we are continuing to pursue funding by Nouns DAO as we believe it to be a positive sum engagement. Below we dive into potential avenues:\n\n### Nouns DAO funded (current)\nTo date, Nouns DAO has funded development costs of Prop House over the past ~12 months (695 ETH). For the current model to continue to work, Nouners would have to agree that the value created for Nouns by Prop House is higher than that of the development costs. In this framing, Nouns DAO is a patron to Prop house where its ROI is the onboarding of high impact builders, the attention generated by Prop House as public infrastructure by Nouns DAO and it being infrastructure for Nouns to run on.\n\n### Fees for usage\nThe true and tried approach is turning on fees at the client and/or protocol. This approach would require a substantial increase in volume (to the order of about 50-100x) to maintain current burn rates. So while feasible, it is not a solution for the short term. \n\n### Experimental\n**Nounish DAO**\nIn prop [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105), we posed Prop House DAO as a plausible avenue to making Prop House sustainable. While it is still a potential route, there are concerns as to whether or not the DAO makes sense at all. At the core of it is whether the Nouns DAO format is appropriate for non-purely meme driven protocols. There’s also the question of whether every protocol needs a DAO and a corresponding governance token. So while the DAO is not out of the question, we believe that with experiments like [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), the answer will become clearer over time. \n**Pure Meme NFTs**\nThere’s a case to be made where Prop House NFTs are minted to hold provenance value. This alone could capture long-term upside in the same way a visual artist and their collectors do. \n\n## Funding Request\n570 ETH to fund development of Prop House protocol & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23). \n- 486 ETH: 3 engineers, 1 designer and 1 all hats.\n- 84 ETH for OpEx including contractors, infra, audits, bounties, translators, etc.\n\nFunds would be received by the [Prop House team multi-sig (3/5)](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992/) where the signers are Seneca, Solimander, CDT, VapeApe and Devcarrot.","endBlock":"16185901","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"114","id":"183","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x177751396d8236569c5c7b04232c7b7281a3b9f3","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":-1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1670518763","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0x9d727911b54c455b0071a7b682fcf4bc444b5596"],"values":["100000000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"537","startBlock":"16155738","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"55","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"0","againstVotes":"2","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"16141338","createdTransactionHash":"0x737527b043841f7ef905c3351e8073f3bedc5a32f2ca1ac576995928e0c892b8","description":"# Nouns funding ZachXBT\n\n**NOTE: This prop is a resubmit of prop 177 since it was cancelled in the \"queued\" stage due to [my error](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1600889013216235525).

Unfortunately it was cancelled as a result. My sincere apologies for the need to revote.**\n\n------\n\n[@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) is a public good serving the crypto ecosystem through tireless research exposing [countless scams](https://investigations.notion.site/). Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\"\n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.","endBlock":"16191738","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"185","id":"184","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0xa555d1ee16780b2d414ed97f4f169c0740099615","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":-1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1670520071","calldatas":["0x0000000000000000000000006ff4ff4fe59d7ec571f36e36961b032027e68cee0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","0x000000000000000000000000b903576f03a1010d7b915783c728b5c39edd9a540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032","0x0000000000000000000000000658f4ed17289144717713adffc2539ef7c2ef8e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032","0x0000000000000000000000008b45d1caccb3593e9f1015ba8e97afb68de3a0d10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032"],"status":"EXECUTED","targets":["0xd8e6b954f7d3f42570d3b0adb516f2868729ec4d","0x6ff4ff4fe59d7ec571f36e36961b032027e68cee","0x6ff4ff4fe59d7ec571f36e36961b032027e68cee","0x6ff4ff4fe59d7ec571f36e36961b032027e68cee"],"values":["0","0","0","0"],"totalSupply":"537","startBlock":"16155847","signatures":["setApprovalForAll(address,bool)","addAllowance(address,uint256)","addAllowance(address,uint256)","addAllowance(address,uint256)"],"quorumVotes":"53","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"2","againstVotes":"0","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"16141447","createdTransactionHash":"0x07a92b8f24710ac12aabec1e74ca53e82c9cdf6a6d29d08efe74694c72353598","description":"# Distributing Nouns Vision Noggles for Proliferation Purposes\n\nWritten by [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch), [Toady](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8), [Maty](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/maty.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8), [Benbodhi](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/benbodhi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) and [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami).\nSpecial thanks to [9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) for helping by creating the [custom contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ff4FF4Fe59D7EC571f36e36961B032027e68ceE#code).\n\n## Intro:\n[Prop 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57) funded the creation of 8,250 pairs of luxury sunglasses made by Nouns Vision.  Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*\n\nAs per the on-chain proposal, 500 tokens of Nouns Vision NFT's (each redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses) were transferred to the Nouns DAO treasury. \n\n## Proposal: \n\nThe authors of this proposal are asking the DAO, on behalf of the communities they represent (Nouns Esports, Gnars, The Noun Square), for an allocation of these sunglasses to be used to further proliferate Nouns DAO as well as help market and drive new buyers towards Nouns Vision.\n\nBy distributing these tokens across various sub-communities, we can further proliferate Nouns through physical interactions with the highest quality noggles available.\n\nThe undersigned sub-communities of Nouns DAO are asking for fifty Nouns Vision tokens each (150 total) from the Nouns treasury in order to continue their efforts of proliferation.\n\n- [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare)\n    - Proposed use: Media appearances from hosts, and distribution via giveaways on Twitter and YouTube, including as prizes for a planned Nouns DAO Awards Show in December.\n- [Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)\n    - Proposed use: Primarily the pairs will be kept on retainer and esports operators will coordinate with players to have them used in prominent competitive-gaming events or live-streaming opportunities. Additionally, a portion will be distributed as gaming competition prizes.\n- [Gnars](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao)\n    - Proposed use: Extreme athletes could wear these in social media posts, at IRL events, and in interviews. All of which have high potential for visibility, especially outside of the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nConversation towards this effort has already been taking place in the #57-sunglasses channel of the Nouns Discord server. For further context, see the initial post towards this idea [from Gami](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/940715393901789336/1012904461380882503) and continued discussion [from Worthalter](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/940715393901789336/1025188064877879316) who suggested distributing pairs from the treasury.\n\n\nAdditionally, our sub-communities would be interested in exploring Zora's functionality of a \"[Finders Fee](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/5961853-how-to-set-a-finder-s-fee#:~:text=Sellers%20can%20set%20the%20Finder%27s,paid%20to%20the%20referrer%27s%20address)\" to further incentivize the promotion of Nouns Vision, with the goal to aid in selling out the entire collection.\n\n*(`*`) Even though the total number of mints is around 1800, this includes 500 for Nouns DAO, 500 presumably reserved for the special edition disco noggles, and 250 for the team.*","endBlock":"16191847","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"182","id":"185","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"2","delegatedVotesRaw":"2","id":"0xa903c06bf35286f6d1cdad25396748353979a44c","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":1}},{"createdTimestamp":"1670671991","calldatas":["0x00000000000000000000000057dadf47646c7b4313ac9c6f71faee1fb550391b000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000320efa9cf0","0x","0x0000000000000000000000002ec701813cb705426d64d3a6eb032cdf1aae5ebe000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000320efa9cf0"],"status":"CANCELLED","targets":["0xd97bcd9f47cee35c0a9ec1dc40c1269afc9e8e1d","0x4f2acdc74f6941390d9b1804fabc3e780388cfe5","0xd97bcd9f47cee35c0a9ec1dc40c1269afc9e8e1d"],"values":["0","312423881226829803365","0"],"totalSupply":"539","startBlock":"16168429","signatures":["sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)","","sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)"],"quorumVotes":"80","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"4","againstVotes":"57","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"16154029","createdTransactionHash":"0x47fc3eda977b880fc632b1907b11b304ee92a548cb5cd7360297e95153954ed8","description":"# House Of Nouns\n\n![house of nouns (1).png](https://imgur.com/ZdV5hbZ.png)\n\n[Click to watch trailer **⌐◨-◨**](https://youtu.be/8YKFK_h4kQU)\n\n# **TLDR**\n\nWe're requesting 340 ETH for 6 months to continue building [House of Nouns](https://twitter.com/houseofnouns), a supercharged platform + context layer for Nouns governance. We want to make governance participation fun. \n\nOur vision is to create a governance platform that is both delightful and easy to use, empowering voters to effectively govern NounsDAO. The client is being created on top of an upcoming open-source framework, built by nounish developers, for nounish developers.\n\n# Current progress\n\nWe've had early success with [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf/), with many Nouners and non-Nouners alike expressing their love of the intuitive interface. We want to continue building on this success and make it easier for people to participate in governance in an engaging way.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.40.34 PM.png](https://imgur.com/D7F1Q0a.png)\n\nNot familiar with House of Nouns?

In talks with many more communities.\n    \n    [https://houseoflilnouns.wtf](https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/proposals/69)\n    \n    [https://gnars.house](https://gnars.house) \n    \n- ~13.5% registered-user market penetration\n    - 170 registered users / 1263 total members in Nouns (delegates + Nouners + anyone who has voted or made a proposal on-chain or in Prop House)\n\n# **Core vision and goals**\n\nOur vision is to make it easier for voters to participate in Nouns governance by providing rich context, intuitive conversation tools, and seamless integrations with other Nounish platforms. This will be built on top of an open framework, empowering developers and solving impactful problems specific to nounish governance. \n\nIn short:\n\n- Provide all context on proposals, voters, builders, and team members, and view all conversations from Discord, Twitter, and Discourse in one place\n- Build a custom forum client directly into HoN that is backwards compatible w/Discourse, allowing users to create and discuss proposal drafts and get early feedback\n- Provide first-class support for Nouns forks and Prop House, and deeper integrations with Atlas, Federation and Agora\n- Create the open source House of Nouns framework, serving core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API, paired with a developer friendly SDK for building on top of House of Nouns infrastructure\n\n## Product Breakdown\n\n### **Context layer**\n\nWe will attach more information to proposals, such as FAQs, comments, relevant links, conversations from other platforms, video attachments, and more. We're currently working with @maty.eth on integrating data from [proposals.wtf](http://proposals.wtf). \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.20.48 PM.png](https://imgur.com/NWxsu7o.png)\n\nWe also will provide more context on Nouners, builders, and team members, such as their past proposals, voting record, and Agora profile, directly in HoN. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.35.06 PM.png](https://imgur.com/b8zipr3.png)\n\nAfter a proposal is executed, we will make it easy to see what has been delivered as a result.\n\n### Forums + conversation stack\n\nWe're building an alternative forum client like Discourse that pulls data from Discourse, and integrates token signaling and Ethereum-based identities. This will be built into House of Nouns and will allow users to create and discuss proposal drafts, get early feedback, and graduate drafts to proposals. It will also provide context on builders and [members](https://collective.xyz/nouns/members), and allow token-based voting.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.19.55 PM.png](https://imgur.com/oXSPL8Y.png)\n\nWe also want to provide more intuitive ways to get early community consensus, such as upvote/idea boards. This will allow users to easily move from an idea to a draft proposal, get comments, and then move to an on-chain proposal with ongoing comments and voting.\n\n### Integrations\n\nDeeper integrations with other Nounish products like Nouns Atlas and Nouns Agora. \n\nView conversation from Discord, Twitter, Discourse etc. in-line on [houseofnouns.wtf](http://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\nFirst class support for Nouns forks, Prop House, Federation, and other governance sources\n\n- one-click governance clients for Nouns forks\n- vote on Prop House rounds directly in HoN with intuitive and easy UI\n- Federation integration (ex: vote on HoN as a Gnars holder)\n\nWhile we will make sure our infrastructure can support all Nounish communities, we will focus on solving problems specific to Nouns governance in the next 6 months. We believe this is where we can have the biggest impact.\n\n## House of Nouns Framework\n\nWe are building an open source framework to give builders the tools they need to build custom governance and discussion experiences for their communities. We will build House of Nouns on top of this framework, in a similar vein to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) being both a builder and end-user of NextJS. \n\nThe main components of the framework are:\n\nOpen access to core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API.\n\nReact [SDK](https://github.com/collectivexyz/sdk) for developing on top of House of Nouns infrastructure, including hooks to access data, pre-built components etc. \n\n## Differentiation\n\nAgora approaches the problem of low governance participation from the delegation perspective. Don’t want to vote? Delegate to someone to do it for you. \n\nHouse of Nouns approaches it from the conversation and context-aggregation perspective.  Empowering Nouners to vote independently and be empowered to think for themselves. \n\nBoth approaches are valid and necessary for the ecosystem to grow. We will be working closely with Agora to ensure we don’t build the same things and otherwise waste valuable energy. \n\n## Success Metrics\n\nOur goal is to have 30% or more of the Nounish ecosystem using (voting/discussing/viewing) House of Nouns *every week*. Currently, about 14% are registered users. We believe that with further improvements to the proposal conversation stack and better user experience, we can reach this goal. \n\nUltimately, our goal is to have the House of Nouns framework and SDK integrated into 10 or more clients by July 2023.\n\nWe will use these as the two primary metrics to evaluate our success in 6 months.\n\n# **Transparency & decentralization**\n\nAs a governance platform, we want to avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures:\n\n- Building the House of Nouns framework as an open source public good\n    - Offer up all data through APIs and a developer friendly SDK\n    - Transition discussion data to open data layers as soon as an attractive option has wide adoption / traction\n    - Offer a React SDK for components and data fetching\n- Current House of Nouns team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of NounsDAO.\n\nOur goal is to open-source the core building blocks of governance and discussion, and provide killer developer tooling on top of the HoN rails so anyone can build custom experiences for their communities and subcultures. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe plan to generate revenue by offering bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities. Our goal is for the HoN client to become self-sustainable within 12-16 months. These upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. \n\nFor the HoN framework, we’re exploring alternative public goods funding routes (Nouns model, Gitcoin etc.) so we can be empowered to continue building something maximally useful for the entire ecosystem. \n\n# ********Team********\n\nWe are a small startup [(collective.xyz)](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) that has been building for Nouns and won the governance client mandate [round](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) 3 months ago. \n\nHouse of Nouns team:\n\n[dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_) - 9 years in software, longtime crypto hacker, cofounder [@collective.xyz](https://twitter.com/collective.xyz)\n\nwhise - lead data engineer ex: Amazon / longtime buildor\n\n[Wojciech](https://kocjan.net/) - Killer product engineer, built [nounslaunchpad.wtf](https://nounslaunchpad.wtf)\n\n[Tim G](https://github.com/timmyg) - former head of engineering at crypto startup, full stack maestro\n\nwith support from [rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w) and [jac](https://github.com/jac18281828)\n\n# Funding Request\n\nWe compare closely to other proposals, like [Agora’s 3-month proposal](https://houseofnouns.xyz/proposals/154) (170 ETH for a team of 4 for 3 months (14 ETH per mo./ person), or Nouns AI Pod (12.75 ETH per mo./ person). \n\nWe request 340 ETH in USDC to fund development of House of Nouns framework & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).\n\n• 330 ETH: 4+ engineers (13.75 ETH per mo./ person)\n\n• 10 ETH: funding for Prop House round(s) to build out alternative clients and views into governance+discussion on top of the HoN framework.  \n\n50% deposited immediately to the teams wallet via [USDC payments contract](https://nouns.wtf/vote/172).\n\n50% USDC streamed over a period of 6 months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community.

We'll build tools for users to generate & access their own animations quickly and easily for use in any project. There's 20 unique and thoughtfully crafted animations to choose from with over 467,000,000 possible animation outcomes.\n\n* Through a front-end app, anyone can enter a Noun ID or mix and match traits to create their own custom Noun and export animations on the spot.\n* Developers will be able to programmatically access any of these animations instantly and seamlessly through an API and/or a URL.\n* Interact with your Noun (including custom ones) through an interactive app on a daily basis with actions like eating, sleeping, playing, and more! The status of each Noun will change throughout the day and you can tend to it accordingly to keep it alive, happy, and healthy.\n\n## Introduction & Background\n---\nHello Everyone,\n\nI'm Jeff (aka heyjeff.eth, jefe) and I’ve been developing an app over the past year that aims to engage NFT collectors by bringing their NFTs to life. Quick backstory:\n\nThe concept was inspired by the popular Japanese phenomenon ‘Tamagotchi’ released in the late 90’s. Each handheld device contains a virtual friend the user must tend to in order to keep it alive, happy, and healthy. Interestingly enough, it’s a style of game that you don’t necessarily ‘beat’ or ‘win’. It’s more of an experience of having a buddy that you can play with, care for, and watch grow throughout it’s lifespan, forever.\n\nI thought it’d be fun if people could do the same with their NFTs, so I decided to build a prototype. At first it started out as just a silly napkin sketch, but now we’re proud to say we’ve recently finished adding support for all 6,969 CrypToadz, each with 11 unique animations totaling over 75,000 files! *(That’s 7.6 GB of raw toad data)*. For those who own a CrypToad, you can check out the app [here](https://tinycitizen.xyz).\n\nHere’s some footage:\n[![CrypToadz Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/KHs4MZi.png)](https://vimeo.com/780511900)\n\n\n## Motivation and Goals\n---\nWhat we’re aiming to do is leverage the tech we’ve developed for CrypToadz and adapt it to build tools so that anyone can generate, access, and download Nounish animations on demand for cc0 use.\n\nTo do this, we’ll develop an easy-to-use Build-a-Noun app through which anyone can choose a pre-existing Noun or build their own by mixing and matching traits at will or at random. Users will be able to preview animations on the fly and then instantly download any or all of the animations they like, with the option of exporting the individual animation frames as well. The app is future-proofed too, so every Noun that is born each day will be readily accessible.\n\nNot only that, but any animation for any Noun configuration can be easily accessible via a back-end API and/or a URL for developers to use in their web apps instantly and seamlessly.\n\nAs an added bonus, anyone can immediately interact and play with their Noun or custom Noun through our other interactive app we’ve already built!\n\nUltimately, the goal of all of this is to empower people to actively use Nouns in engaging, refreshing, and easy ways to help spread the meme.\n\n## Build-A-Noun App, prototype & poc\n(early prototype shown, does not represent final product)\n[![Build-A-Noun Prototype](https://i.imgur.com/Viv5UfU.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/777492078)\n\nThe 20 total actions and states are: idle (breathing/blinking), happy/loved, laughing, talking, dancing/head bob, eating: pizza, mushroom, veggies, fruit, hamburger, playing a gameboy, sad/crying, drinking: coffee, water, tea, health/mana potion, tired, sick, and sleeping.\n\nThe above is an early prototype solely to convey the concept of the Build-A-Noun app. The final product will have a redesigned and intuitive interface, with way more options and functionality, such as:\n* Select transparent or any background color (hex or rbg input)\n* Quick select any existing Noun ID config\n* Searchable traits by ID or name\n* Randomize traits button\n* Flip the animation (left-facing vs right-facing)\n* Change output animation speed\n* Apply an rbg tint to the animation\n* Apply a black and white filter to the animation\n* Resize animation to specific dimensions\n* Export all individual frames for a given animation\n* Pick and choose which animations to export\n* Add text overlays\n* Share-to-Twitter button to quickly tweet your creations \n\nFlipped![](https://i.imgur.com/bIxYeRQ.gif) B/w filter![](https://i.imgur.com/eI9okhg.gif)\nrbg(255, 5, 555) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/1n2f2xY.gif) Sped up 3x![](https://i.imgur.com/FsMU13t.gif) Flipped, 0.75x speed, rbg(293, 65, 5) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/AaLiqTR.gif)\n\n\n*Examples of animation customization options*\n\nIn total, we’d pre-generate 8,700 animation files (435 Nouns assets x 20 unique states), each with an average of 30 frames per animation. That's  a total of 261,000 individual frames to bring this vision to life! There are 23,377,200 possible combinations for a Noun, and 467,544,00 possible animations outcomes (23,377,200 x 20)!\n\n\n## Why?\n---\nCurrently, there isn't a scalable tool in the Nouniverse that allows users to quickly produce a wide range of highly customizable Nounish cc0 animations on demand.\n\nGame developers, content creators, and everyday users can benefit from such a tool as a building block to create even bigger and more Nounish things!\n\nWe're trying to fill this gap in the Nounscape by providing STOMMs (*Super Tool of Mass-Memeification*) in an area that is lacking. With this tool in place, I believe we'll see an explosion of new Nounish content for everyone to use and enjoy as they see fit.\n\nPlus, being able to interact with your Noun deepens our emotional connection to them!\n\n## Sneak Peeks\n---\nWe made the following animations for Lil Nouns for fun as a test, but the same concepts apply for Nouns. Here's a peek at 10 out of the 20 total states. Choose any background color you like, or none at all (transparent).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u0ZdEUw.gif)\nIdle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p9ecpWa.gif)\nEating pizza\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ygk8hBI.gif)\nSleeping\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/euvT8qO.gif)\nPlaying Gameboy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqHr6cL.gif)\nHappy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wnxg4Uj.gif)\nSad/Crying\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1TBwth1.gif)\nDrinking coffee\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LmXiVcz.gif)\nSick\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qbxc4Wy.gif)\nTired\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oIWI1F3.gif)\nHealth potion\n\n## Interactive App ~ Bonus ~\n---\nAnyone who owns a Noun or builds one with our Noun Builder app can interact with it on a daily basis through an app we've already built (works on mobile too)! Each Noun will be animated to reflect it's current state or action - it will truly feel like your Noun has come to life!\n\nHere are the following mechanics:\n\n4 Stats (each max val of 100):\n* Fullness\n* Energy\n* Happiness\n* Health\n\n3 Player Actions (each grants XP needed in order to level up):\n* Feeding – Increases fullness and happiness\n* Sleeping – Increases energy and health\n* Playing – Increases happiness, decreases fullness and energy\n\n3 Conditions:\n* Can’t sleep while starving\n* Can’t play while sleep-deprived\n* Can’t eat while sick\n\n3 Items (purchasable with points earned from completing actions)\n* Coffee – Triples the amount of XP gained, but cannot sleep for 8 hr\n* Health Potion – Replenishes health to full\n* Mushroom (can be easily reskinned to another object) – 1 of 4 potential effects, chosen at random:\n    * Jumbles stats at random\n    * Earn a random amount of XP\n    * Gain 1 level\n    * Eat a poisonous mushroom and die\n* All stats decay by 2 every 4 hours automatically, forever\n* Sometimes, at random, 1 of the 4 stats will be depleted to zero if all stats are non-zero\n* If neglected for ~8 days, the NFT will die\n* NFTs can be revived, but lose 1 level and costs points\n* Highest levels are ranked in a public leaderboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PaRnHTs.gif)\n*Nounish interactive gameplay demo (limited features)*\n\n\n## How is this valuable to Nouns??\n---\n\n### 1. Public Goods & Network Effects\n\nEveryone from experienced devs to everyday users will be able to generate & access Nounish animations on demand, either through the API or the front-end tool within a few clicks.\n\nThis means anyone -- enthusiasts, developers, and/or content creators can save countless hours by bootstrapping these animations to be used any way they like! Some examples include: \n\n* Enrich existing apps or websites\n* Use as stickers and/or emojis for Discord servers\n* Use the animations to develop a game\n* Use them to make merch and/or NFTs\n* Enhance Nounish media like tweets, infographics, or videos\n* Use as pfps\n* Download the individual animation frames to make sprite sheets\n* Use the frame data to create lip-synced animated avatars for video/audio calls\n\n-- the possibilities are endless!\n\nThe end result will lead to quicker turnarounds for prototypes and media creations, and act as a catalyst for the proliferation of new Nounish content overall.\n\nQuote from devcarrot, Nounder:\n\"This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations. Would you be willing to make the data accessible to other developers via a public API? Maybe with something like a license that requires attribution? It could be interesting to have Nounish characters hanging out on the various projects’ sites; imagine Timpers’ disco floor but with TinyCitizen characters rendered in real time.\n\nThe disco floor:\n![](https://cdck-file-uploads-europe1.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/a/a30c42ece4e30f7f4aac00f6979b82a057b19eb9.gif)\"\n\n\n### 2. Rally community around organic and fun reward systems\n\nThrough the interactive app we’ve already built, it provides opportunities for users to earn rewards through quests.\n\nAs an example, we’ve successfully rewarded 80+ unique CrypToadz players with a CrypToadz hat and pair of Nouns glasses to those who reached level 10 with a CrypToad through the interactive app. Everyone shared how much they loved this event!\n\nThis provides a more rewarding experience because the merch drop felt earned rather than simply given. In turn, it promotes camaraderie and a sense of fellowship among the community who want to achieve a mutual desired result by partaking in shared experiences.\n\nAny Nounish DAO that wishes to engage their audience can task their community with completing certain actions through the app and granting them an award upon completion.\n\n**Reward bundle: CrypToadz Hat + Noun Glasses + NFT NYC Coaster**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xupiot6.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f8PToWz.jpg)\n\n*pssst… This event is still ongoing! If you want a CrypToadz hat and Nouns glasses you can still grind for them! Find me on Discord :wink:*\n\n### 3. Tap into & activate new creators and builders\nIf we make these assets readily available for people to access in an engaging and easy manner, it could open up doors for new people to enter the ecosystem.\n\nThose that need assets to build on Nouns in new or interesting ways but have no developer or animation experience can often feel discouraged not knowing where to start.\n\nWith the Build-A-Noun app as a building block, we can inspire existing Nounish community members as well as potential new ones to create something Nounish easily and quickly. Anyone can get up and running with tens, hundreds, or thousands of animations ready to use within minutes.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n---\n* Create an easy-to-use front-end tool + website where anyone can create and download unique cc0 gifs for any Noun configuration on the spot. The 20 unique states/actions are:\n    * Idle (breathing + blinking)\n    * Happy/Loved\n    * Sad/Crying\n    * Laughing\n    * Talking\n    * Sleeping\n    * Dancing/Head bob\n    * Eating\n        * pizza\n        * mushroom\n        * fruit\n        * veggies\n        * hamburger\n    * Drinking\n        * coffee\n        * water\n        * tea\n        * health potion\n        * mana potion\n    * Playing a gameboy\n    * Tired\n    * Sick\n* Create a back-end API, where anyone can instantly grab any animation for any Noun configuration for use in their web apps programmatically via an API key and/or a URL\n* Revamped front-end design with mobile-friendly version to generate animations on the go!\n* Integration with our existing free-to-play side-app where users can interact and play with their Nouns (already built)\n* Publicly host the raw base64 encoded png frame data for all Nouns assets in json format so anyone can use the animation frames how they like\n\n## Timeline\n---\n### Total: 10 weeks\n\nEach individual trait needs to be manually animated for all 20 states. That's roughly ~1,000 files per week (435 x 20 / 8). Some take shorter than others because they're static in a given animation, or they mimic the same motion as another animation and can be ported. Regardless, there is a lot of upfront work to be done.\n\n### Weeks 1-4:\nFront-end work, complete site redesign and development. Mobile-friendly optimization. Developing gif creation software with various customization options.\n\n~50% of animations files complete\n\n### Weeks 5-8:\nBack-end work on API creation. Work on image processing and manipulating animation frame data. Create hosting solution for animation data.\n\n~100% of animation files complete\n\n### Weeks 9 & 10:\nHook-up back-end to front-end. Allow 2 week buffer for testing & bug fixes, or any last minute optimizations/improvements.\n\n## Who we are\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EkzLRN9.gif)**heyjeff.eth** - Full-Stack Dev / Design / Vision / Logistics\n\nI’m an engineer, problem-solver, and purveyor of ideas that I believe are worth telling.\n\nI've been involved in the NFT space since early 2021 and became Noun-pilled a couple months ago through some people I’ve met within the CrypToadz community.

We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token-gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we’d describe [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore) as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)\n\n\nBy prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren’t yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don’t use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn’t open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. \n\n## Creator Contests … WTF?\n\nCreator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.\n\nCreating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the world's largest open-source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders – allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimilar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here’s what we offer today …\n\n* Submitter Rewards\n    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)\n    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)\n\n* Voter Rewards\n    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.\n    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.\n    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)\n\n* Participant Restrictions\n    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)\n\n* Voting Strategies\n    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings\n    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)\n\n* Twitter Integration\n    * Collect submissions via Twitter interactions\n    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via Twitter\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n    \n* Additional Parameters\n    * Vote total visibility\n    * Anonymous Submissions\n    * Self Voting\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)\n\n\n## Our Nounish Journey: part 2\n\nBefore Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 45 nounish creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)\n\n\n## Goals for the funding period\n\nFor this funding period, we’d like to focus on “Top of the funnel” funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. Our goal is to fund 100+ nounish creatives in the 3-month window.\n\nWhile bringing the codebase out of “MVP mode” so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we’ll work on the following upgrades:\n\n* Support native video and other media formats\n* Add vote audit reports\n* Add voting capability for Noun delegates\n* Experiment with new voting strategies\n* Simplify contest initialization process.\n* Improve our twitter algorithms\n* UX redesign - It’s time for CC to get Nounish\n\n\nWe’d also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of “low quality” submissions, and we’ll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Defining success\n\nSuccess at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We’ll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:\n\n* New creatives\n    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities\n* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers\n    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals\n* Between Nounish extension communities\n    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.\n        * TNS and Composables co-host a round\n        * Multi-community voting\n        * Twitter contests\n\nOf course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed web app to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the \"public edge\" as possible and see the potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  \n\nDefining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we’ll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.\n\n\n## Prop House\n\n*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*\n\nWhile we haven’t really heard this much, it’s a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.\n\nHalting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. \n\nAt worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities – all powered by Nouns.\n\n## Team\n\nWeez: frontend, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\n## Links\n* [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore)\n* [Github](https://github.com/calabara-hq/calabara)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calabarahq)\n\n## Budget\n\n60 ETH for continued development\n\n3/5 Multisig tasked with sending 30 ETH of project funds to the team wallet upon execution, and setting up a 3-month stream for the remaining funds.\n\nSigners:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26.transfer(\n    60.0 ETH\n)","endBlock":"16227654","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"22","id":"188","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"2","delegatedVotesRaw":"2","id":"0x1e66a3d0a6a327b1f29e8acf3a3d9e1e4e088683","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":2}},{"createdTimestamp":"1670982587","calldatas":["0x"],"status":"ACTIVE","targets":["0x0658f4ed17289144717713adffc2539ef7c2ef8e"],"values":["694200000000000000000"],"totalSupply":"544","startBlock":"16194159","signatures":[""],"quorumVotes":"81","proposalThreshold":"1","abstainVotes":"66","againstVotes":"118","quorumCoefficient":"1000000","createdBlock":"16179759","createdTransactionHash":"0xa3443cb30d226354eda121b1b0e6b37c1aed8050f6013e141305a8b878c24db5","description":"# Extremely nounish\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0jlR9rL.gif)\n\n## 💸 Requesting 694.20 ETH to cross the chasm\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4S66vhJ.png)\n\nLet's scale the provision of extremely nounish public goods through culturally relevant activations.

We learned that instead of just sponsoring individuals, we should empower them to uplift their communities as a whole:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLwvCJb.jpg)\n\nNow we're an internet collective of over 750 members ready to actualise our subculture's rendition of the \"nouns virtuous cycle.\" We will establish the first \"never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing)\" to power our CC0 media machine.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aObap4q.gif)\n\nGnars have funded [over 30 proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth), submitted the [first nounish DAO to DAO proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) ([origin](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x013702a15624613befa0ed1488350610f8d98c3d71c82e240183e8692600a5f9)), cast the [first nounish cross-DAO vote](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_/status/1589946679872360448) ([federation.wtf](https://www.federation.wtf/daos/gnars)) and have led by example to help countless nounish builders.\n\n## 🤯 Here's what 69 ETH looks like\n\nRather than bore you with the details, this timed open edition NFT is a highlight reel of what we've achieved since Proposal 51 passed. Click the embed below and it will take you to [our Zora minterface](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdd930e878bdf23a78573998a451464c5bf56eeca).\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/IMAUuEA.jpg)](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdd930e878bdf23a78573998a451464c5bf56eeca)\n\n\nPacking everything we've done into a 90 second video is near impossible, so we hope what made the cut serves as a memento for those who collect it. Many thanks to [4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1600505145397317634) and [Jacob](https://jacob.energy/predicting-provenance.html) who inspired our making of this compilation and its subsequent minting. Shoutout [Kai](https://twitter.com/m3thaverse), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye) and [Trizzy](https://twitter.com/trizzytrunk) for pulling everything together at short notice.\n\n## 🤔 What'll 694.20 ETH look like?\n\nBrazil taught us that cultural relevance is incredibly important. For example, the giant noggles you've seen people skating are permanently installed in Rio de Janeiro at Praça XV, alongside other iconic urban sculptures installed each year by Coletivo XV.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uOAnnqd.png)\n\nOur giant noggles are in the same town square as the giant skateboard, one of the most photographed landmarks in Rio, third only to Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf which are both globally recognisable.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/H5xaVey.png)](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1598537522141069312)\n\nThe ability to do more activations like what we've seen in Brazil depends on the roll-out of the greatest onboarding effort Nouns has ever seen. Let's explore some of the ways we plan on scaling:\n\n### Builder onboarding via seasonal Prop House rounds\n\nGnars DAO has attracted builders who've paved the way with their creative approaches to activating their communities. Many hail from emerging markets where we can have an outsized impact and their values are already closely aligned with ours as crypto natives.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uYMx45z.png)\n\n[Prop House](https://prop.house) allows us to run mandated funding rounds each season that will see builders competing for the opportunity to uplift their respective communities. Each round will fund activations as described below and we've already received expressions of interest from suitable candidates throughout South America, Africa, Asia and more.\n\n### Public goods delivery through builder-led activations\n\nBuilders funded each round will be equipped with everything they need for public goods delivery through thoughtful and culturally relevant activations. Leaning on our experience in Brazil, we'll help motivated individuals become local heroes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/56iuFKh.gif)\n\nOur community will help them to implement nounish obstacles, crypto wallets and NFTs (10% of Gnars are for onboarding), merch and stickers, photo walls and banners, and to receive delivery of remuneration, Noun 189 skateboards and various types of noggles.\n\n### Hashtag campaigns to catalyse social media curation\n\nWe're not looking for \"[flash in the pan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_in_the_pan)\" type events and are committed to the pursuit of the \"[nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).\" We will leverage hashtags like **#ThatsGnarly** across all platforms to launch ongoing crowd-sourced social media campaigns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B82OcJz.jpg)\n\nSuch a rudimentary approach removes all barriers to entry so that the first step in joining the movement is simply posting to a hashtag. We can meet newcomers where they already express themselves, curate the best content based on impact and prepare creators for [a Web3 revolution](https://thatsgnar.ly).\n\n### Creator onboarding to the Gnars Revolution protocol\n\n[Revolution](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution) is a protocol from [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz) (and [gnars.house](https://gnars.house/)) designed to enable the earning of governance rights through contributions other than capital. We are working closely with the team to give Gnars holders a reddit-like curatorial experience for content submitted to #ThatsGnarly.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wCsJkxJ.jpg)\n\nContent surfaces on a Web3 leaderboard at [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly) after being submitted by extreme sports creators across social media. Competing in the \"gnarketplace\" for attention, top performing content is minted and sold as NBA Topshot style NFTs in daily auctions – *ie. Prop House for tricks.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fxNEx13.jpg)\n\n*Trick NFTs released under CC0, Gnars NFTs drawn from 10% of supply already allocated to athlete/artist onboarding and each GNAR is equal to one Gnars DAO governance vote.*\n\n## 🚀 How we'll spend 694.20 ETH\n\nWe're a passionate community with domain expertise who know very well the agility required to succeed. Our plans are subject to change and funds will be disbursed through our own proven governance, but this should give you some idea of what to expect:\n\n### Activations\n\nSkateboard production and shipping, existing skate park refurbishments, localised merchandise production, Nouns Vision and Bigshot noggles, fabrication of more giant noggles and so much more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ5qksI.jpg)\n\n*Additional locations where sculpture installation is not allowed will be activated using NFC enabled \"⌐◨-◨\" beacons that prompt visitors to get involved.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2OGWJ1z.jpg)\n\n*This is a rough mockup of small indestructible noggle fixtures that can be glued discreetly at existing spots without degrading an obstacle's user experience.*\n\n### Autonomy\n\nSince inception, our community have had access to Noun 189 in order to participate in Nouns DAO governance. The time has come for Gnars DAO to acquire two Nouns of their own. Enough funds to purchase 2 Nouns will be allocated to auction bidding.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vD0S5Ty.gif)\n\nAdditional funds from our ongoing NFT auctions will bolster this funding request, further efforts laid out in this proposal, and allow us to continue onboarding professional team riders who represent us throughout their respective industries as ambassadors.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAs required we will provide remuneration through governance to top notch contributors already attracted to Gnars including [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Alberto](https://twitter.com/alberto_campora), [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556), [Vlad](https://twitter.com/vladhzc), [Sam Mason de Caires](https://twitter.com/sammdec), [Brian](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj), [Rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori), [Lochie](https://twitter.com/lochieaxon) and [Knowhow92](https://twitter.com/theocharis_ch). We will approach these engagements on a competitive basis much like our activations. \n\nWe've been working hard to gain qualitative insight and to establish the most effective operational structure. As a community we have access to unrivalled industry expertise through our relationships with pro athletes, artists, media and brands. We look forward to inspiring many more of our connections through the very same thing that's gotten us to where we are – word of mouth.\n\n> 📝 **NOTE:** Funding receival to [gnars.eth](https://gnars.wtf/), a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e/settings/owners) multisig [governed by Gnars DAO](https://gnars.house/) members as described in [Proposal 51](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) with backup signers being [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Oni](https://twitter.com/apenoun), [Noun 22](https://twitter.com/undeadnoun22) and [Blockbird](https://twitter.com/_blockbird).\n\n## 🛹 We're built for onboarding\n\n[I recently asked nouns twitter](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1596051642725830656), \"what is the biggest problem with nouns dao that needs solving?\" I was delighted to receive a response [from 4156 directly](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1596061577794330624): \n\n> \"same as every other crypto token imo: distribution. how to onboard maximum number of high quality, aligned etc. participants into the network\"\n\nOnboarding is something we take seriously at Gnars and we are uniquely positioned to onboard the next million [proliferatooooors](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x8c5effc5fb5d3805212713115427f4efe82a40be) by staying \"extremely nounish\" and applying the true grit and perseverance we've learned through our commitment to action sports culture.\n\n### Questions?\n\nJoin [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/gnars), subscribe to [gnarly.news](https://gnarly.news/), check out [gnars.com](https://gnars.com), or boardslide into our DMs on Twitter [(@gnars_dao)](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao) or Instagram [(@gnarsdao)](https://www.instagram.com/gnarsdao/). \n\nThanks everynoun for taking the time to peruse this funding request.\n\n[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), like origami.\n\n⌐◨-◨","endBlock":"16230159","executionETA":null,"forVotes":"114","id":"189","maxQuorumVotesBPS":1500,"minQuorumVotesBPS":1000,"proposer":{"delegatedVotes":"0","delegatedVotesRaw":"0","id":"0x387a161c6b25aa854100abaed39274e51aaffffd","tokenHoldersRepresentedAmount":2}}]}}
